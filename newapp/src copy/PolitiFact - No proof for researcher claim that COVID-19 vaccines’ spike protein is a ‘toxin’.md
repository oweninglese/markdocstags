A university expert claimed on talk radio that he has new evidence that  COVID -19  vaccine s produce a "toxin."
The credentials of Byram Bridle, a  viral  immunologist at the  University  of Guelph in  Ontario , Canada, include  research  funding from the  Canadian   government  and the  Canadian  Cancer Society, as well as dozens of publications in  research  journals.
But experts told PolitiFact that, despite a document Bridle cites, there is no evidence to back his claim that what is known as the  vaccine s’ spike protein produces a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage.
"There is no data that the spike is a toxin," said Dr. Drew Weissman, a  vaccine  expert and professor of medicine at the  University  of Pennsylvania. "The document he cites is an anti-vaxxer product with no real scientific data supporting its claims."
Bridle’s interview sparks social media burst
Bridle began a  Canadian  talk show interview with a dramatic warning: "I’ll forewarn you and your listeners that the story I’m about to tell is a bit of a scary one." 
Describing himself as "very much pro- vaccine ," Bridle said he had assembled scientific information that he intends to make public, but "your listeners are going to be the first to hear the public release of this conclusion." 
He claimed the information shows that the spike protein produced by the  vaccine s, which is intended to prevent the  corona virus  from infecting the body, does not remain in the shoulder muscle but gets into the blood — and can lead to clotting, bleeding, heart problems and neurological damage.  
"In short, the conclusion is, we made a big mistake," Bridle said. "We didn’t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin, and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens in some people, they can cause damage, especially in the cardiovascular system. And I have many other legitimate questions about the long-term safety, therefore, of this  vaccine ."
The interview led to claims widely shared on websites and social media, including posts that linked to an article from the website of the Hal Turner Radio Show, which uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. The article carried this headline:
"Doctor on  COVID  Vax: ‘We Screwed-Up. We didn't realize the Spike Protein is a TOXIN’ Does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own Spike Protein Toxins in their own bodies?"
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its  News  Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Explaining "spike proteins"
 COVID -19 m RNA  (messenger  RNA )  vaccine s use the human body’s natural  immune  response to its advantage. The shot contains the recipe for making the molecule known as the spike protein, which the  COVID -19  virus  uses to bind to cells. Once the cell receives these instructions, it creates the protein and displays it on its surface. The  immune  system then spots the unknown protein and makes  antibodies  to fight it.
The technology in the  vaccine s made by  Pfizer -BioNTech and  Moderna  stems from  research  that began in the early  1990 s, said Weissman. He and his colleague Katalin Karikó, a senior vice president of BioNTech, are credited with the breakthrough discovery that enabled these  vaccine s to be safe and highly effective.
The federal Centers for  Disease  Control and Prevention, which calls the spike protein harmless, says: "Our  immune  systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an  immune  response and making  antibodies , like what happens in natural infection against  COVID -19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection."
Bridle’s evidence seen lacking
PolitiFact emailed Bridle on  June  3 asking for the evidence to back his statement, and received an automated reply from him. The reply said that the radio interview led to "vicious attacks," including a website that emerged  May  28 bearing his name. Bridle’s email said that he believes the website — which anonymously critiques Bridle’s claims — to be libeling him.
Also in the email, Bridle cited a document that he said supports what he said in the interview, and that he would be writing a more comprehensive public report.
The document claims that "recent studies suggest that the spike protein produced in response to vaccination" could result "in damage to various tissues and organs. This risk, no matter how theoretical, must be investigated prior to the vaccination of  child ren and adolescents." 
On that point, the document links to one Journal of Respiration article published Dec. 31, days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to the  Pfizer -BioNTech and  Moderna   vaccine s. The article describes how the spike protein in the  corona virus  affects lung cells and says that because the spike protein will be administered in  vaccine s, "it is critical to understand the  biological  effects of this protein on human cells to ensure that it does not promote long-term adverse health consequences."
Weissman said Bridle’s conclusion that the  vaccine s are toxic is off-base, especially given that the  vaccine s do not deliver spike protein to the lungs.
"Reports of spike protein trouble are interesting and important for  corona virus  infection, but they do not mean that the  vaccine s themselves are going to cause similar problems," said a  May  4 commentary in  Science  Translational Medicine, a publication of the  American  Association for the Advancement of  Science .
The commentary notes that "the spike protein is not released to wander freely through the bloodstream," and says the fact that the  vaccine s "are aimed at the spike means that they’re protective in more ways than we even realized."
Despite the widespread administration of the  vaccine , Dr. Walter Orenstein, professor and associate director of Emory  University ’s Emory Vaccine Center, said he is "not aware of any data to support the allegations" made by Bridle. 
"It would be nice to have any direct evidence if this were true," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious  Disease s at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
"We are at nearly 300 million doses given (in the  United States ) and a robust surveillance system in a population that is certainly not shy about reporting problems" about  vaccine s to public health authorities, Offit said.
Our ruling
A post widely shared on social media claims a  viral  immunologist said  COVID -19  vaccine s’ spike protein means people are being inoculated "with a toxin."
Experts say there is no evidence that the spike protein produced by the  vaccine s is a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage. The  Canadian   viral  immunologist who made the claim has not produced evidence to back it up.
We rate the claim False.
