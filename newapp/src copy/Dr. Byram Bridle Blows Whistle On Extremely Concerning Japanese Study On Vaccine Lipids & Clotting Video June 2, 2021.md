Dr. Byram Bridle Blows Whistle On Extremely Concerning  Japanese  Study On Vaccine Lipids & Clotting [Video]  June  2, 2021] - Fact Check "Vaccine"
Excerpt
Dr. Byram Bridle exposes the  Japanese  study showing where the spike protein (synthetic m RNA ) accumulates in the human body once it gets into the blood stream. This he says explains the reason we are seeing so many adverse reactions. What many people around the world already knew, this is genocide, we now have some solid scientific  research  to show the mechanism.

Dr. Byram Bridle exposes the  Japanese  study showing where the spike protein (synthetic m RNA ) accumulates in the human body once it gets into the blood stream. This he says explains the reason we are seeing so many adverse reactions. What many people around the world already knew, this is genocide, we now have some solid scientific  research  to show the mechanism.
Dr. Bridle is an associate professor and  viral  immunologist in the Department of Patho biology  at the  University  of Guelph. His  research  interests include developing a better understanding of how the  immune  system responds to  viral  infections as well as designing immunotherapies for the  treatment  of cancers and infectious diseases.
Bridle, who was awarded a $230,000 grant by the  Canadian   government  last year for  research  on  COVID   vaccine  development, said he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the  Japanese  regulatory agency to get access to  Pfizer ’s “biodistribution study.”
Biodistribution studies are used to determine where an injected compound travels in the body, and which tissues or organs it accumulates in.
“It’s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger  RNA  [m RNA ]  vaccine s go after vaccination,” Bridle said in an interview with Alex Pierson where he first disclosed the data. “Is it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It’s very disconcerting.”
