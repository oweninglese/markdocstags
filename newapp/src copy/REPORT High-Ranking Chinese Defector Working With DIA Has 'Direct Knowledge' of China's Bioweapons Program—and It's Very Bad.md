REPORT: High-Ranking  Chinese  Defector Working With DIA Has 'Direct Knowledge' of  China 's Bioweapons Program—and It's Very Bad – PJ Media

In an exclusive story at RedState, Jen Van Laar reports that sources inside the intelligence community say a high-ranking  defector  from  China  has been working for months with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). According to Van Laar’s confidential sources, that high-ranking  defector  claims to have knowledge of special weapons programs in  China —that include  bioweapon s.
Adam Housley first reported via Twitter on Thursday that “the increased pressure on  China  in recent days is due to a  defector  with intimate knowledge” of the program. According to Housley,  FBI  director Christopher Wray “didn’t know right away because they wanted to make sure they got all they needed before telling him.”
In fact, Wray was “ambushed” with the information, according to Van Laar’s sources, as was the  CIA . “Sources say DIA leadership kept the  defector  within their Clandestine Services network to prevent Langley and the State Department from accessing the person, whose existence was kept from other agencies because DIA leadership believes there are  Chinese  spies or sources inside the  FBI ,  CIA , and several other federal agencies,” according to the report.
Why was the  defector  so important that he had to be kept under wraps?
Housley says it’s because the  defector  has information on the origins of the  Wuhan   virus : “ China  is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that  corona virus  originally came from a lab.” He later clarified: “US intelligence has a  Chinese   defector  with  Wuhan  info. AND  China  is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that  corona virus  originally came from a lab.”

According to RedState’s sources, “the  defector  has been with the DIA for three months” and has provided “an extensive, technically detailed debrief to US officials.”
“In DIA’s assessment, the information provided by the  defector  is legitimate,” wrote Van Laar. “Sources say the level of confidence in the  defector ’s information is what has led to a sudden crisis of confidence in Dr. Anthony  Fauci , adding that U.S. Army Medical  Research  Institute of Infectious  Disease s ( USA MRIID) personnel detailed to DIA have corroborated very technical details of information provided by the  defector .”
All of this raises many questions. Why, “suddenly,” did the U.S. legacy media en masse turn-tail and start pointing fingers at  China  and doubting  Fauci ?  Why did left-wing outlets like the  Washington  Post and BuzzFeed “suddenly” decide it was the right time to drop  Fauci ’s emails—just days after the lab-leak story was “suddenly” no longer verboten on social media?  Fauci ’s emails revealed what we’ve been reporting here at PJ Media for months (mostly behind the paywall for our VIP subscribers to avoid the Gestapo social-media censors): that  Fauci  was working with a  Chinese  scientist from the  Wuhan  lab; that he asked Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg to help with  COVID  messaging; and that he signed off on funding for dangerous gain-of-function  research  in  Wuhan .

One gets the sense that a dam the size of Three Gorges on the Yangtze River is about to blow. The question will be, as it almost is when political figures are caught in a coverup: What did they know and when did they know it? And who knew what was really going on?
If any of this turns out to be true—particularly the suggestion that  China  may have intentionally unleashed the most deadly  bioweapon  in world  history —you might want to begin thinking about where you’re going to spend the U.S.-Sino  War . If, as Housley claims, the  FBI ,  CIA , and other federal agencies are swarming with  Chinese  spies, it would constitute the biggest national security failure in U.S.  history —and the most deadly.
The implications are terrifying.
