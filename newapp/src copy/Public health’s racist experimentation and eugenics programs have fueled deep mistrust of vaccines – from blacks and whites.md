Mass marketing can’t erase the Tuskegee syphilis  experiment s , mass sterilization camps, or botched  vaccine  and birth control trials on the poor
ANALYSIS
 June  8, 2021 (LifeSite News ) –  Public health  agencies are engaging in hand-wringing about “ vaccine  hesitancy” – the growing phenomenon of people questioning the safety and necessity of  experiment al  vaccine s against  COVID -19. They blame “anti-vaxxers” for fueling the “misinformation” behind reluctance to take shots and say it is preventing herd  immunity . But a look at the  history  of how public health agencies in America and abroad have treated their “herds” in the past may be enough to explain why so many are questioning mass-marketed injections.
Last week,  FOX   News ’s Tucker Carlson pointed to a rash of statements by Democrats and left-leaning analysts blaming “ white  Republican men” for  COVID   vaccine  refusal.
“‘Why don’t they want it — these  white  men who by and large were Trumpers?’ asked CNN anchor Chris Cuomo,” Carlson quipped.
Blacks declining  vaccine s
In reality, the  White  House  and CNN got their figures wrong, or as Carlson surmised, they were “lying again.” Centers for  Disease  Control and Prevention ( CDC ) data tracking  vaccine  status by race and ethnicity to  June  6 shows that black rates of  corona virus  vaccination are trailing significantly behind that of  White s in America: 42% of Asian  American s and 32% of  white   American s had received “at least one dose” of a  COVID   vaccine  compared to just 27% of Hispanics and 23% of black  American s.
So, while  white s make up a greater number of the nearly 64% total of  adults  that have received at least one shot of the  corona virus   vaccine  in the U.S., on a per capita basis the biggest refusers may or may not be Republican, but they are not  white . They are black and Hispanic.
Even as  American s are awash in  vaccine s and injections are being mass-marketed and incentivized with everything from lottery tickets to free beer and Kri spy  Kreme donuts, about 24% of the adult population does not intend to get a shot and, according to a recent Gallup Poll, are not likely to change their minds any time soon.
It doesn’t help that evidence is stacking up against Dr. Anthony  Fauci , chief  White  House   corona virus  adviser, for his role in funding the “gain of function”  research  at the lab that created the very  virus  that he has now been put in charge of eradicating.
Not-so-distant past: Tuskegee  experiment s , mentally disabled  kids  intentionally infected with hepatitis, nearly 70,000 sterilized against their will
 Public health  has responded by creating campaigns that have “prioritized” blacks and other minorities, the elderly, and the disabled. These people are most at risk of  COVID -19, health agencies say. But these are the same groups that public health has “helped” in the past with targeted eugenics campaigns and racist  experiment ation of new  drugs .
For nearly 20 years, mentally disabled  child ren at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York, were intentionally infected with  viral  hepatitis – fed  chocolate  milk mixed with the feces of infected patients –for the purpose of  vaccine   research .
Here are just a handful of public health atrocities from the recent past:
Nearly 800 Guatemalans (including orphaned  child ren,  prison ers, and insane asylum patients) were deliberately infected with syphilis and other infectious sexually transmitted agents as part of study sponsored by the  Public Health  Service, the National Institutes of Health, the Pan  American  Health Sanitary Bureau (now the  World  Health Organization's Pan  American  Health Organization) and the Guatemalan  government . The  experiment s  went on between  1946  and  1948  and were allegedly facilitated by Johns Hopkins  University , drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The director of the study, John Charles Cutler, also directed the infamous and more enduring Tuskegee syphilis  experiment s .
The Tuskegee syphilis  experiment s  were conducted by the U.S.  Public Health  Service between  1932  and  1972  in Tuskegee, Alabama. Cutler, with the blessings of the public health industry and tax funding, recruited 399 poor black men with syphilis infections and offered them sham “ treatment s” which his  research  team knew wouldn’t work, so they could chart the progress of untreated disease. The  research ers went to elaborate and deceptive lengths to keep the men from being treated with penicillin which had been a recognized, effective  treatment  since  1947 , to keep them – and observe without them knowing they were untreated – in a state of lethal disease. The  experiment s  only ended when a  whistleblower  inside the public health system told the New York Times and the studies became public. By that time, just 74 men who thought they were being helped by public health were still alive. Of the original 399, 128 men had  died  of syphilis or its complications, 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their  child ren had been born with congenital syphilis – all for the sake of “public health.”
In  2015 ,  CDC  senior scientist William Thomson called Brian Hooker, a scientist and the parent of an autistic son, and admitted that he and four other scientists at the  CDC  who had published a major study finding no connection between MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccination and autism had in fact destroyed evidence that showed a statistically significant link between the  vaccine  and autism in black boys.
Eugenicist Margaret Sanger, who founded the abortion franchise Planned Parenthood, was clearly referring to people of color and the disabled when she argued for the “gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction, of defective stocks” and “human weeds.” She got drug maker G.D. Searle the funds to test its first birth control pills on unwitting women in Puerto Rico and Haiti who didn’t know they were part of clinical trials in the  1950 s. Three of the women  died . Their  death s were never investigated. The 17% of the women who experienced side-effects including blood clots and strokes were dismissed as “psychosomatic” by the  research ers; FDA officials back in the U.S. approved the  drugs  based on the  research .
For nearly 20 years, mentally disabled  child ren at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York, were intentionally infected with  viral  hepatitis – fed  chocolate  milk mixed with the feces of infected patients –for the purpose of  vaccine   research . Between  1963  and  1966  Saul Krugman of New York  University  told  parents  of prospective enrollees at the school (which Senator Robert F. Kennedy had called a “snake pit” after visiting it unannounced) that they could get into the school in exchange for “vaccinations” which were in fact hideous  vaccine   experiment s .
Nearly 70,000 blacks and  white s in mostly poor communities were sterilized against their will through an entrenched and widespread public health eugenic sterilization campaign that spanned decades in the  United States . Blacks were sterilized at about three times the rate of  white s and one study found that one in four  American   Indian  women were sterilized against their will in the  1970 s.
India has long been a target of population controllers at groups including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the  United States  Agency for International Development ( USA ID). These population controllers have worked with local  government s to drastically cut births throughout the country by mass sterilization drives that routinely cause women to die or be injured. The women are frequently not told what they are undergoing.
Hundreds of  child ren in India today continue to be paralyzed by  vaccine -induced polio because health officials and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation use dangerous oral polio  vaccine s – abandoned by the  West  long ago – for the sake of “convenience,” according to doctors there.
In  2013 , a  government  investigation concluded that a Bill and Melinda Gates-funded organization had conducted a large-scale clinical trial conducted on behalf of pharmaceutical human papilloma  virus  (HPV) Gardasil  vaccine  makers on poor girls and boys in India in violation of ethical and legal regulations which amounted to “ child  abuse.” Seven girls had  died . More than 2,700  child ren were put in the trials without written parental consent, the  government  committee reported. In  January   2015 , the Daily Mail interviewed boys and girls in India who said they had no idea they were  testing  a drug and who suffered weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, and menstrual problems.
‘ Public health  has never been a friend of the black  American ’
It’s against this backdrop of public health’s dark  history  that many blacks are pushing back against  COVID  vaccination – injection of an  experiment al drug that was fast-tracked and granted Emergency Use Authorization only because clinical trials are incomplete.
“We have trust issues, a lot of us because of some  history  of things that have been done in the past. So, a lot of us are skeptical. We want to wait and see,” Emma Agnew, the president of the Craighead County NAACP in Jonesboro, Arkansas told a local news station last week.
Kevin Jenkins,  CEO  of the Urban Global Health Alliance, co-produced a 2021 documentary called Medical Racism with the Children’s Health Defense, founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which explores racist views endemic to current “public health” practices.
“The global tyrants of Big Pharma and Big Tech have been clever in the last couple of years in hijacking the language of social justice,” Jenkins told LifeSite News . Worse than that, he added, is that they are co-opting black  American  leaders in public health, civil society, and churches, to promote their products and campaigns as a social justice or “equity” issue – trying to convince blacks that  white   American s are privileged to get the  vaccine  and black  American s are being left behind.
“They’re using the exact same  science  that Margaret Sanger used in  1929 ,” Jenkins said, when Sanger convinced a host of black  American  leaders that when she was interested in serving them when in fact she was serving Nazi racist and eugenic ideology.
“Until you understand that,” said Jenkins, “until you understand  history , until you understand the exploitation, you will never understand that public health has never been a friend of the black  American . And public health has never been a friend of the poor  American .”
