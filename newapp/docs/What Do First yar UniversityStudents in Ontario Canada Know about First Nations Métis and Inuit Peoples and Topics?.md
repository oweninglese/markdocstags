Abstract
We disseminated the Awareness Questionnaire to the first-year cohorts at 10 Ontario universities in 2014. Co-designed with over 200 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit educators
and community members across Ontario, the survey investigated how students are learning to think about colonialism and its relationship to Indigenous peoples and Canadian
society. Statistical analysis of 2,899 student responses reveals that first-year university
students who graduated from Ontario high schools are substantially unaware of Indigenous presence and vitality. The majority of students do not understand the fundamental laws structuring conditions of life for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people or the
contributions Indigenous peoples make to all aspects of Canadian society. Although they
know slightly more about what is happening with regard to Indigenous peoples today,
students have little sense of the historical circumstances and forces that shape current
events. Arguably, students are this ignorant because the Ontario K–12 curriculum, which
remains deeply inadequate, is the primary source of information for most students.
However, when students have opportunities to engage with Indigenous perspectives and
topics, it can make a difference to what students know and think. These results indicate
that curricular reform is key to eradicating mass ignorance but cannot occur in isolation.
Teacher education programs must play a central role in enacting the promise of new
curricular emphases.

des autochtones et leurs activités. La majorité des étudiants ne comprennent pas les lois
fondamentales qui régissent les conditions de vie des membres des communautés des
Premières nations, Métis et Inuits, ni la contribution qu’apportent les peuples autochtones à tous les aspects de la société canadienne. Bien qu’ils en sachent un peu plus
sur ce qui se passe actuellement à l’égard des peuples autochtones, les étudiants n’ont
que peu de connaissances sur les circonstances et contraintes passées qui façonnent les
événements actuels. Les étudiants sont sans doute ignorants parce que le programme
d’études ontarien de la maternelle à la 12e année, qui demeure très insuffisant, demeure
pour la plupart leur principale source d’information. Cependant, offrir aux étudiants
l’occasion de se familiariser avec les points de vue et la culture des autochtones peut
avoir un impact sur ce qu’ils connaissent et pensent. Ces résultats indiquent que la
réforme des programmes d’études est essentielle pour éradiquer l’ignorance généralisée, mais qu’elle ne peut à elle seule y arriver. Les programmes de formation des enseignants doivent jouer un rôle primordial afin de mettre en place de nouveaux programmes
d’enseignement scolaire.

Introduction
This article shares the results of the Ontario Student Awareness Questionnaire, part of a
project that investigates how post-secondary students in provinces across Canada have
learned to think about colonialism and its relationship to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
peoples and Canadian society. Disseminated online to 42,916 first-year students at 10
Ontario universities1 in the fall of 2014, the questionnaire sought to engage students in
learning better about Indigenous peoples and topics and to explore barriers to that learning. Following Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s observation that “real power lies with those who
design the tools,” the questionnaire includes a multiple-choice knowledge test co-designed
with over 200 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit educators and community members across
Ontario, as well as questions on where students learned what they know, their social
attitudes, and demographics (Smith, 1999, p. 38; Ermine, 2007). The knowledge test and
associated questionnaire reflect what First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people associated
with Ontario universities believe all residents of Ontario and Canada, especially university-level students, should know to be able to act responsibly as treaty partners and fellow
citizens and neighbours.
In Canada, many Indigenous leaders and activists, as well as decolonial and
anti-racist scholars, attest that the principal barrier to decolonization is ignorance. Ignorance of the structural injustices at play in land claims and land use negotiations, resource
extraction, governance and jurisdiction, identity definition, health, education, child welfare, and justice systems all work to uphold and retrench inequities faced by Indigenous
people/s (Coulthard, 2007; Dion, 2009; Environics Institute, 2016; Maddison, Clark, &
de Costa, 2016; Regan, 2010; Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2015). Ignorance
in this sense is not a mere absence of knowledge, to be alleviated through the acquisition
of new facts. Rather, it is systemic and foundational to structural methods of not knowing that are deeply linked to power and hierarchy (Calderon, 2011; May, 2006; Medina,
2013; Steyn, 2012; Sullivan & Tuana, 2007). Such methods of not knowing are embedded in and cultivated through social institutions including the media, the justice system,

and especially education, through what is taught and what is omitted from curricula and
textbooks (Apple & Christian-Smith, 1991; Calderon, 2014; Kaomea, 2000; Rose, 2007;
Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernández, 2013), through how content is taught (Battiste, 2013;
Cannon, 2012; Donald, 2012), and through the mindsets of teachers and teacher educators
(Dion, 2007; Higgins, Madden, & Korteweg, 2015; Waldorf, 2014). As many decolonial
scholars demonstrate, education in Canada has long played a central role in cultivating
modes of rationalization that work to legitimize racism and Indigenous assimilation
(Battiste, 2013; Cannon & Sunseri, 2011; Coté-Meek, 2014; Schick & St. Denis, 2005;
St. Denis, 2009; Vincent & Arcand, 1979). Consequently, as the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC) emphasized in its 2015 final report, ministries of education, schools,
colleges, and universities bear particular responsibility to foster in Canadian classrooms
the critical historical consciousness and mutual respect upon which nation-to-nation
relationships are built (TRC, 2015; see also Dion, 2007; Tupper & Capello, 2008; Tupper,
2013, 2014). The work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has prompted educational institutions across Canada to enhance their efforts to identify and confront the systemic prejudice embedded in course content, funding priorities, administrative decision
making, and the priorities of teachers, teacher educators, faculty and staff (Coté-Meek,
2017; Favel & Stoicheff, 2015; Macdonald, 2016; Trimbee & Kinew, 2015). Yet, as the
quantitative results reported here suggest, many Ontario students lack even the most basic
understanding of colonialism and Indigenous presence identified by Indigenous educators
and community members as necessary for cultivating the ethical relationality central to
decolonization (Ermine, 2007; Donald, 2012). This article makes three key contributions: (1) It is the first in-depth investigation of student learning of its kind, combining
co-design, a large sample size, rigorous statistical analysis, and careful attention to the
language and structure of curricula and texts. (2) The article shares the question topics
considered important by over 200 Indigenous educators and community members, which
is important for curriculum writers and policy-makers and relevant for teachers and
developers of teacher education programs. (3) We suggest that ignorance runs deep and
is multi-faceted, requiring concerted and coordinated effort on the part of ministries of
education, school boards, faculties of education, and post-secondary institutions to challenge it. Teachers can only act in a certain range of influence when they have to contend
with inadequate curriculum. Yet curricular reform is but one part of the equation. Teacher

education programs are also accountable to shifting their colonial conditions and challenging systemic ignorance in ways that foster decolonizing relations as called for by the
TRC.

Methods
The Awareness Questionnaire was developed over a period of 10 months, in more than
60 meetings, and with more than 200 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit educators and community members affiliated with 10 Ontario universities. The questionnaire’s development
was an iterative process—to each meeting we brought the questionnaire and went through
it, word for word, for importance, accuracy, and resonance with co-designers’ experiences and understanding. Co-designing the questionnaire transformed its structure and
content and foregrounded the importance of listening and decolonizing our own ways of
thinking, a process that is ongoing (Schaefli & Godlewska, submitted). We disseminated
the Awareness Questionnaire online to the first-year cohorts at 10 Ontario universities in
the fall of 2014. Given the difficulty of surveying Grade 12 classrooms across Ontario,
we focused on first-year university students as a proxy for what students have learned
from their K–12 education. Of the 42,916 students invited to participate, 5,150 (12%)
responded to the questionnaire, 2,899 of whom graduated from high school in Ontario
and completed the questionnaire. The following analysis focuses on these 2,899 students
as it is possible to examine the influence of the K–12 Ontario curriculum.
The Awareness Questionnaire contains 93 items across six sections designed to

Indigenous presence (geography)

First Nations, Métis, and Inuit cultural continuity (culture)
Laws or circumstances structuring First Nations, Métis, and Inuit lives (governance)
What is happening for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples in Canada today (current events)

For analysis, we coded each test question into one of these mutually exclusive categories:
geography (seven items), history (seven items), culture (eight items), governance (seven
items), and current events (seven items). We also classed topics according to whether or
not and to what degree they are mentioned in the 2003–15 Ontario curriculum, which
guided most of the education received by these students.
Statistical differences in participants’ performance were examined through
paired-sample t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). The null hypothesis for these
analyses was that demographic groupings would not influence awareness. For demographic variables with two groupings, we employed a paired t-test. For demographic variables with three or more groupings with equal variance, we used an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Bonferonni correction (α = 0.05). The Bonferonni correction reduces the
chance of a type 1 error (i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true) (MacDonald
& Gardner, 2000). For demographic variables with three or more groupings with unequal
variance, an ANOVA (α = 0.05) with a Games-Howell post hoc test was used. Where
there were significant differences, Cohen’s d or partial η2 were calculated as a measure of
effect size (Cohen, 1988). Statistical differences in participants’ responses within checkall-that-apply items were examined using contingency tables (cross tables) and Pearson’s
chi-square tests of independence (chi-square test). A chi-square test using a z-test of
column proportions with Bonferonni adjustments to significance level (α = 0.05) was employed to identify significant differences. The null hypothesis for these analyses was that
demographic groupings would not influence awareness. All data analyses were completed
using the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences version 22 (SPSS v. 22).
As the questionnaire was a knowledge test rather than an opinion or satisfaction survey, and as it was focused on a controversial topic that many Canadians prefer
to avoid, we expected a low response rate. We have since moved to in-class surveys
and raised response rates to above 80%. While gaining access to university classrooms
is a significant challenge, conducting the survey in classes enhances the educational

opportunity for students and instructors. If the response rate for this study creates a bias
in the data, it is that these students are probably more interested and knowledgeable than
most, as they took the time to complete the questionnaire on their own time (i.e., not in
class).

Student Performance on the Knowledge Test
The distribution of the data suggests that students have had little exposure to the test
question topics. The average score on the test was 24.28% (SD = 16.06%, range = 0 to
86%). Students’ test scores were relatively normally distributed, with a floor effect, meaning that more students performed below the median than above it. If this were a typical
university test, designed to reflect what students have been taught in any given course,
such a distribution would require careful reconsideration of the test instrument. However, this test was co-designed with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit educators to reflect
the knowledge they deem students should know. The test is consequently not restricted to
topics mentioned in the K–12 curriculum. Students do, however, perform better on questions covered in the curriculum. We coded each test question according to whether it was
in the 2003–15 Ontario curricular documents and associated textbooks, which guided the
K–12 education received by these students. We focused on the Grades 1–6 social studies
courses, Grades 7 and 8 history and geography courses, Grade 9 geography, and Grade 10
history and civics. The rationale for focusing on these courses is twofold: they are mandatory for all students and have the greatest likelihood of including content related to colonialism and Indigenous peoples. Based on our analysis of the curriculum and textbooks,
we organized test questions into three categories: covered in core courses (four items),
maybe covered (13 items), and not covered (19 items). Table 1 provides a summary of
students’ performance by test question theme and nature of coverage in curriculum and
associated textbooks.

** First Nations, Métis, and Inuit.

We conducted a paired samples t-test to assess whether students performed better
on test questions covered or maybe covered in mandatory courses compared to questions
on topics not mentioned in these courses. Students performed significantly better on material that was definitely or maybe taught (M = 25.54, SD = 17.79) compared to topics not
mentioned in the curriculum (M = 22.34, SD = 16.68); t[2898] = 13.66, p < 0.001. These
results indicate that students retain what they are taught, signalling the real potential of
teacher education and curricular reform for improving education about First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics in Ontario.
Students performed best on questions pertaining to current events (M = 34.3,
SD = 24.87). Students scored highest on a question asking who has an obligation to
uphold treaties (40.7% correct), followed by questions on the prime minister’s 2008
Residential School apology (39.1%), the availability of federal post-secondary funding
for First Nations and Inuit students (36.8%), the effects of changes in legal definitions of
Indian status (33%), and the Idle No More Movement (24.3%). Troublingly, nearly a fifth
of first-year respondents (17.7%, n = 512) believe that all Indigenous students receive
free post-secondary education, a finding that demonstrates the important role schools,
universities, and colleges must play in fostering respect for First Nations’ treaty rights
and Inuit constitutional rights.
To respect the knowledge students do have, we structured some questions as
check-all-that-apply, allowing more nuanced analysis. Two of the current events questions, the manifestations of systemic racism and the consequences of Residential Schools,

are questions that require check-all-that-apply answers. The frequency of each answer
indicates that students are more aware of some aspects of systemic racism and the consequences of Residential Schools than of others. While nearly 70% of respondents
identified biased coverage in mainstream media as a manifestation of systemic racism,
only 55.3% identified unsolved crimes against women, 54.7% identified omission in the
curriculum, and 50.3%identified overrepresentation in prisons. Moreover, only 11.7%
of students selected all of these four correct answers, suggesting that nearly 90% do
not understand the depth and breadth of systemic racism. Similarly, while two thirds of
students are aware of the role of Residential Schools in attacking First Nations, Métis,
and Inuit ways of being, many have little sense of the ongoing trauma wrought by the
schools. The seven correct answers to this question fall into two categories: four answers
focus on the traumatic and ongoing effect on individuals and families, and three answers
focus on cultural loss. Of the 66.7% of participants who selected all three cultural loss
options, only 42.3% were also aware of ongoing trauma. Of the 34.7% of participants
who were aware of the traumatic and ongoing effect of the schools, 80.9% answered
all parts of the question correctly. This pattern suggests that cultural loss is forefront in
the awareness of the majority of students, but many are unaware that Indigenous people
continue to live with the trauma inflicted by the schools. There is another risk with the
focus on cultural loss. Narratives of degradation in the absence of narratives of strength
and resurgence reinforce discourses of Indigenous damage and decline, a mentality that
easily supports settler interests (Alfred & Corntassel, 2005; Million, 2013; Tuck, 2009;
Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernández, 2013). That these students are much more aware of loss
than they are of resurgence demonstrates the need for better education about Residential
Schools. Such education, promoted through both curriculum content and teachers’ pedagogical strategies, would foreground the historical and contemporary stories, knowledge,
and experiences of Indigenous people(s) and emphasize that colonialism is not the only
story of Indigenous lives. It would also help students develop the critical consciousness
to identify the underlying assumptions, motivations, and values that have come from the
history of colonization, in order to challenge them (Battiste, 2013; Regan, 2010; TRC,
2015; Tupper, 2014).
Students did second-best on culture questions (M = 31.01, SD = 20.65). Students’
responses to the culture questions suggest that while they have some general awareness
of Indigenous ways of knowing and the importance of language and culture, many do

not see Indigenous people(s) as part of Canadian society. Students performed best on a
question on widely spoken Indigenous languages (60.9%, the best-answered question
on the test) and scored relatively well on questions on the meaning of the phrase “all
my relations” (39.5%) and Inuit cultural persistence (36.4%). Students did less well on
a question on First Nations, Métis, and Inuit athletes (30.5%), though still above the test
average. Students did most poorly on questions on the Inuit inuksuk2 (9.9%), Indigenous
authors (16.4%) and musicians (21.1%), and positive changes led by First Nations, Métis,
and Inuit people (26.5%). Low scores on the authors and musicians questions, despite
their presence on the curriculum, suggest that many students are not taught well about
Indigenous contributions to the arts. Similarly, while over 60% of respondents selected
“pride in identity,” “cultural rejuvenation,” and “language recovery” as correct answers to
the question on positive changes led by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people, they were
less likely to select “post-secondary graduation” (49.7%), “self-government” (47%), or
“business ownership” (40.8%). This suggests that while two thirds of respondents have
some awareness of Indigenous cultural vitality, they do not see cultural vitality as linked
to success in business, self-government, and post-secondary education. Together with
students’ poor performance on the arts questions, these results suggest a prevailing misconception that Indigenous people are not present in contemporary arts, post-secondary
education, government, or business.
The pattern of responses to questions on governance suggests that when students
learn about governance at all, that learning is focused on the interpretation of Indigenous rights by the Canadian state rather than on the territories, philosophies, and critical
perspectives of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people(s). While students performed close
to the test average on governance questions (M = 24.62, SD = 20.02), their performance
on individual questions varied according to whether the question focused on the Canadian
government or on the roots of Indigenous rights. Students did best on questions focused
on the Canadian government’s framing of Aboriginal r ights, scoring above the test average on questions on Aboriginal and treaty rights in the Canadian Constitution (26.5%
correct) and trends in the Canadian government’s approach to land claim agreements
(24.5%). Students scored more poorly on questions that emphasize the pre-European-contact origins and enduring nature of Indigenous land and resource rights: Aboriginal title,

treaties, and scrip (19.8%); the 1763 Royal Proclamation (9.2%); and the 2003 Powley
case (8.1%). Such an uncritical approach to governance allows denial of the existence and
diversity of Indigenous sovereignties; works to reduce conflicts around land, resources,
and cultural continuity to a matter of majority rule; and portrays government as innocent
of assimilative interests (Grande, 2004; Lawrence & Dua, 2005; Coulthard, 2007). Together these work to preclude imagination of Indigenous resurgence and futurity.
The most important, deliberate, cultivated, and sustained act of legislated racism
in Canadian colonial rule is the Indian Act. Yet students have little understanding of its
aims or ongoing existence and effects. Only 18.9% of students understand the role of the
Indian Act in legislating and subordinating Indigenous identities and sovereignties. Only
38% answered a question on the ongoing assimilative effects of the gender discrimination
embedded in the Indian Act correctly. There is nearly a 20% difference in student performance on the two Indian Act questions. This is probably less a reflection of students’ superior knowledge of its gendered effects than of the structure of the test question: co-designers advised us to focus on the effects of gender discrimination; consequently, it was
necessary to explain its nature in the body of the question. This enhanced the educational
value of the question but also made it a little easier, increasing students’ scores. Overall,
these governance questions require in-depth and critical education about the disciplining
of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and rights through Canadian law. It is unlikely
that students could, or should, learn this from the media or informal discussion.
While students have some awareness of the role of government in attacking Indigenous ways of being and knowing, they do much less well on questions that demand
sensitivity to Indigenous autonomies and awareness of the numerous government strategies to sever Indigenous connections to land. Students performed below the test average
on history questions (M = 23.19, SD = 20.46). By far the best-answered history question
is a factual question on who administered the Residential Schools (47.4% correct, the
second-best-answered question on the test). Students did less well on questions requiring deeper awareness of assimilative practices: the assimilative aims of the Residential
Schools (28.1%) and government relocation of Inuit (27.9%). Students performed even
worse on questions that emphasize Indigenous sovereignties, scoring 14% on a question
about the Métis nation and 12.7% on a question on the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and
Council of Three Fires. Students did most poorly on questions that highlight government
strategies to limit Indigenous peoples’ avenues of resistance to colonial attack. Only

17.4% knew when First Nations and Inuit could vote. Only 3.5% understood some of the
early 20th-century government strategies to limit land claims. Students’ poor performance
on these history questions reflects the breadth of the gap between the history they have
been taught and the history deemed important by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people in
Ontario (Schaefli, Godlewska, & Rose, in press). This gap is deeply political, because it
discourages young Canadians’ critical understanding of Canada’s colonial nature. It also
works to dull students’ responses to our collective inherited injustices, by allowing them
denial of epistemic responsibility (Ermine, 2007; Medina, 2013; Whitt, 2016).
Student unawareness of Indigenous presence, either here and now, or in resource
extraction disputes, for example, limits their capacity to engage respectfully with Indigenous people on issues of major importance to all people in Canada today. It is significant, then, that students performed least well on questions assessing awareness of First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit presence (M = 22.29, SD = 18.29). Students did relatively well
on a question on Indigenous languages spoken in Ontario (34%). However, they scored
very poorly on a question on whose traditional territory their university campus is built
(3.3% correct, the lowest score on the test) and a question on whether the First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit population is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same (8%, the second-lowest score on the test). This suggests that while students have some awareness of
the Indigenous nations in Ontario, they have little understanding of Indigenous presence
where they are. It is likewise important, given the commitment of the Canadian government to resource extraction and the disproportionate effect of that extraction on Indigenous people(s) (Cameron & Levitan, 2014; Preston, 2013), that students do not do well
on questions on resource projects of considerable regional and national importance. Only
8.8% of respondents were aware of some of the consequences of the Ring of Fire mining
project in northern Ontario. Nearly 90% could not name the Indigenous nations grappling
with the extraction of the Alberta oil sands. These results demonstrate that universities
have a crucial role to play in awakening students to what is happening around them and
encouraging sensitivity to relationships between signs in their daily landscape and events
and structures at play in Canada, especially with regard to Indigenous peoples and territories. Students did slightly better, though not well, on questions focused on reserves: the
percentage of First Nations people who live off reserve (26%) and the difference between
reserves and traditional territory (39.4%). That students do better on reserve questions
is a reflection of the Ontario curriculum. The curriculum focuses predominantly on First

Nations reserves, neglecting the presence of Métis and Inuit and of First Nations people
in urban areas. It is also silent about Indigenous territories and omits critical Indigenous
perspectives on land theft, removal, and resource extraction.
The prevalence of “Don’t know” and incorrect responses can teach us even
more about the nature of student ignorance. Average performance is raised or lowered
by outliers in the group, but where more students answer correctly than answer “Don’t
know,” we can say that there is greater awareness about that topic in the population.
Conversely, when more students answer incorrectly than “Don’t know,” we can say that
misconception prevails in the population. Five test questions stand out. Encouragingly,
more students answered correctly than “Don’t know” on questions about widely spoken
Indigenous languages (60.9% correct vs. 33.6% “Don’t know”), who administered the
Residential Schools (47.4% correct vs. 39.8% “Don’t know”), and treaties (40.7% correct vs. 38.3% “Don’t know”). Troublingly, misconception is widespread on whether the
population of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people is increasing, decreasing, or staying
the same. Nearly three times more students responded “The population is decreasing”
than “Don’t know” (65.2% vs. 22.4%). This belief is politically important, as it feeds
discourses of ongoing Indigenous decline, a mentality that works to naturalize settler
presence (Dunbar-Ortiz & Gilio-Whitaker, 2016; Wolfe, 2006). Importantly, students who
say they learned most of what they know about First Nations, Métis, and Inuit from their
formal education are significantly more likely to consider that the population is decreasing (p <0.001). This result accords with our analysis of the 2003–15 K–12 Ontario Social
Studies and Canadian and World Studies stream. Despite the fact that the Indigenous
population is not only growing but is the fastest growing population in Canada (Statistics
Canada, 2011), the 2003–15 Ontario curricula and texts consistently frame Indigenous
peoples and topics as of the distant past, succeeded and superseded by the non-Indigenous settler presence (Schaefli et al., in press). Misconception is also apparent in student responses to a question on the proportion of First Nations people living off reserve.
Although at least 70% of First Nations people in Canadian provinces live off reserve
(Statistics Canada, 2013), the majority of students think that most First Nations people
live on reserve (41.6% incorrect vs. 32.4% “Don’t know”). Together with students’ poor
performance on the population question and on the traditional territory question, these
findings suggest a prevailing misconception that wherever Indigenous people(s) are, they
are not here, a conviction shared by first-year university students in Newfoundland and

Labrador (Godlewska, Schaefli, Massey, Freake, & Rose, 2017; Godlewska, Schaefli,
Massey, Freake , Adjei, et al., 2017). As in Ontario, curricula and texts in Newfoundland
and Labrador are encouraging this mentality (Godlewska, Rose, Schaefli, Freake, &
Massey, 2016).
Non-Indigenous students performed much less well on questions about current
events, culture, governance, and geography than did Indigenous students, perhaps because Indigenous students have learned about these topics from sources beyond school.
We investigated differences in student performance based on self-reported identity (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Student performance in each test question category by Indigenous identity
The difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students’ performance was significant for four of the five question themes: current events, t(2702) = 2.852, p = 0.004, cohen’s
d = 0.24; culture, t(2702) = 3.568, p < 0.001, cohen’s d = 0.30; governance, t(2702) =
4.941, p < 0.001, cohen’s d = 0.40; and geography, t(2702) = 5.071, p < 0.001, cohen’s d =
0.40. There was no significant difference between non-Indigenous and Indigenous students
on historical questions, t(2702) = 1.596, p = 0.111. That non-Indigenous students score
nearly 10% lower on geography, governance, and history questions than they do on culture
and current events questions suggests that they are least aware of the history of Indigenous–
settler relations in Canada and of contemporary Indigenous presence.

Where Students Learned What They Know
Where students learned what they know differed significantly between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous students. Students also learned differently about First Nations than about
Métis and about Inuit. We asked students how much they learned about First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit from their personal experience, their own initiative, their formal education, media, friends, family, Indigenous persons, and work, volunteer, or internship
experience (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Indigenous and non-Indigenous students’ sources of learning about First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics
All students consider that they learned most about First Nations, much less about Métis,
and least about Inuit. All students feel that they learned more from school than from any
other source and least from work/volunteer experience. That Indigenous students report
learning “quite a bit” in school may be a consequence of better teaching in schools with
higher proportions of Indigenous students (Archibald & Hare, 2017). These students
may also have taken Native Studies courses in high school. This strong suite of courses,
developed through the considerable efforts of Indigenous educators across the province in
the 1990s, was to be available to any interested student. Yet provincial enrolment requirements and the prevailing prejudice that Indigenous topics are only relevant to Indigenous
students has meant that Native Studies courses are often not offered consistently year-toyear and in most Ontario schools are not offered at all (Chaput, 2012; Strachan & Kidder,
2016). Nevertheless, when these courses are available, students probably learn a great
deal.
While formal education was an important source of knowledge for all students,
Indigenous students are significantly more likely to learn from other sources as well,
F(24, 3223.74) = 14.51, p < .001. Indigenous students are significantly more likely to
have learned what they know from personal experience (p <0.001); personal initiative

(p = 0.003); and work, volunteer, or internship experience (p <0.001). However, nonIndigenous students are significantly more likely to have learned what they know from
formal education (p = 0.014). Media is also an important source of knowledge. That
non-Indigenous students perform significantly less well on the test having learned most
from formal education and media suggests the need for better integration of the knowledge and experiences of First Nations and Métis people(s), and especially Inuit, in formal
education.

Quality of Formal Education
Student reporting on the quality of their education suggests that they know when they
have been taught well or poorly. We asked students how well they consider they were
taught in four grade categories: Grades 1–3, Grades 4–6, Grades 7–8, and Grades 9–12.
Students could respond “Misinformed,” “Not taught,” “Poorly taught,” “Adequately
taught,” “Taught well,” “Taught exceptionally,” “Don’t remember,” and “Not applicable”
(Figure 3).

Students consider that they were taught best about First Nations and least well about
Inuit, with Indigenous content clustered in Grades 4 through 8. Students also considered
that they learned very little in early grades or in high school, patterns consistent with the
curriculum (Schaefli et al., in press). Worryingly, in each grade category between 20% and
50% of students consider that they were not taught about First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
peoples and topics. This too is a reflection of the curriculum, where over 80% of Indigenous
content is framed as optional (Schaefli et al., in press). That so many students are reporting

not being taught suggests that teachers may not be engaging with material construed as
optional. This finding reinforces the need for better teacher and administrative training on
the importance of Indigenous topics for all people in Canada, especially as nearly all Indigenous content in the new 2013–15 curriculum is framed as optional (Nardozi & Mashford-Pringle, 2014; Pratt & Danyluk, 2017; Redwing-Saunders & Hill, 2007; Strachan &
Kidder, 2016). Encouragingly, students who reported that they were taught well or exceptionally well about First Nations, Métis, and Inuit in middle school and high school (Grades
7–12) scored significantly higher on curriculum questions (p < 0.05). Likewise, students
who knew enough to consider that they had been misinformed scored significantly higher
on Residential Schools questions, t(2897) = 2.16, p = 0.03.

Learning from Indigenous People(s) Matters
Some research has shown that increasing contact between people of different backgrounds
and experience can foster empathy and reduce prejudice (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew,
& Wright, 2011; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, 2008). Other research suggests that this effect
depends on the quality of the contact (Askins & Pain, 2011; Denis, 2015). In this study, we
found that greater interaction with Indigenous people and topics increased students’ test
performance, enhanced their willingness to engage with Indigenous perspectives, and made
them more willing to imagine issues from Indigenous points of view. We asked students to
describe the quality of their interaction with Indigenous persons (Figure 4).

The quality of contact students had with Indigenous people had a significant effect
on their test performance, (F(6, 2868) = 58.79, p = 0.001, partial η2= .11). Students who
considered that they had “sustained” or “occasional but significant” interaction with
Indigenous people performed better on the test than students who reported having little
contact, no contact, or were not sure (p < 0.001).
Caring about First Nations, Métis, and Inuit well-being is also linked to better test
performance. We asked students two questions: how much they care about First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit people and how much they care about social justice issues faced by Indigenous people(s) (e.g., disproportionate poverty, murder of women, inequity in housing, education, incarceration, and health) (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Student reporting on how much they care about First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit well-being
Nearly 70% of respondents report caring about Indigenous people and about social justice.
About a quarter of these students care no more or less about Indigenous well-being than
about any other people or issues in Canada. Fewer than 5% do not care at all. These findings are probably not representative of the entire Ontario student population, as the students
who took the time to complete the survey likely care more than most. A two-way ANOVA

well-being and their test performance yielded significant results, F(4, 2717) = 4.417,
p = .001. While higher levels of care about Indigenous people increased students’ test
scores, how concerned participants were with social justice issues did not affect test performance, F(4, 2717) = .882, p = .4874. However, the interaction effect was significant,
F(15, 2717) = 1.962, p = .015, meaning that the effect of participants who cared more
about Indigenous well-being was greater when participants also cared more about social
justice.
Family interest also had a significant effect on students’ test scores. We asked
students to characterize the interest of their immediate family members in First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics. Students could choose one of six set phrases (Figure
6).

Figure 6. Student reporting on the interest of their immediate family members in First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics
The majority of students encounter silence in the home on this topic. Nearly a quarter of
students say their families are interested in First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and
topics (mildly interested and significantly interested combined). Worryingly, over 10%
consider their families to be bored by the whole topic or think Indigenous topics do not
matter anymore. A one-way ANOVA showed that how students answered this question had
a significant effect on their test score, (F(7, 2891) = 42.3, p < 0.001, partial η2= .093). The

more interested a student’s family, the higher the student scored on the test (p < 0.05).
Even those students who consider their families to feel that it is all in the past and does
not matter anymore perform better on the test than those who say that it never came up
as a topic of conversation (p = 0.004). In other words, any engagement on the part of
students’ families with Indigenous topics is associated with increased knowledge in this
group of students.

Students’ Interest
Students’ exposure to Indigenous perspectives and topics is also linked to their interest
in learning more. We asked students what might be the cause of any limitation to their
knowledge about Indigenous peoples and topics in Canada. Students could choose one or
more of nine set phrases (Figure 7).

Figure 7. Student reporting on the limitations to their knowledge about First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics
The vast majority of students consider that the principal barrier to their knowledge is
inadequate coverage in school, reinforcing the need for better education. Nearly a third
of respondents consider that Indigenous topics are not relevant to them. A smaller, but
still substantial, proportion of students consider that they do not want to know. The nearly

10% of students who indicate that they have learned things they have had to unlearn are
likely more aware than most, as are the students who say that their knowledge is not
limited.
Importantly, students who indicate that they are not interested in engaging with
Indigenous topics are significantly less likely to have interacted with First Nations, Métis,
or Inuit people or had exposure to Indigenous topics. Chi-square tests showed that students who say “My family is not First Nations, Métis, or Inuit so it is not relevant to me”
(X2 (6, N = 2869) = 46.76, p < 0.001) or “I don’t want to know about these issues”
(X2 (6, N = 2869) = 16.20, p = 0.013) are significantly less likely to have had sustained
engagement with Indigenous people. Students who say they do not want to know are
also less likely to have been taught about Indigenous peoples in high school
(X2 (7, N = 2899) = 40.44, p < 0.001). Both of these groups of students are significantly
less likely to consider that they should have been taught more (X2 (2, N = 2899) = 87.19,
p < 0.001); (X2 (2, N = 2794) = 239.84, p < 0.001). That the lack of exposure to Indigenous topics and perspectives negatively affects students’ willingness to engage with them
reinforces the importance of centering Indigenous territories, philosophies, and critical
perspectives in public education.
While engagement with Indigenous people and topics affects student interest, so
do family attitudes. We asked students how they would characterize the views of their
immediate family members towards First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and topics. To
respond, they could choose one or more of seven set phrases (Figure 8).

Figure 8. Student reporting on the attitudes of their immediate family members

Again, overwhelmingly, students encounter silence in the home. While at least 25% hear
expressions of pride and concern (i.e., they are concerned about FNMI people, they are
proud of FNMI people), nearly 30% receive more negative messages (i.e., they feel that
FNMI people receive privileges, does not matter anymore). Independent samples t-tests
indicated that students who considered their family members to be proud of First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit peoples are significantly more interested in Indigenous peoples and topics, (t(276.5) = 11.54, p < 0.001). However, students who say that their family members
feel that First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people receive privileges are significantly less
likely to be interested in social justice for Indigenous people(s), (t(780.98) = 2.00,

people, (t(770.36) = 2.01, p = 0.045). Troublingly, these students are more likely to say
that they feel informed, (t(2805) = 3.12, p = 0.002). These findings reinforce the need for
a public education system that counters familial prejudice.

Students’ Political Views
Exposure to Indigenous perspectives and topics also affects students’ attitudes towards
social inequity. We asked students how they feel when First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
people have fewer advantages and opportunities than they do. Students could choose one
or more of 10 set phrases (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Student reporting on how they feel when First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
people have fewer advantages and opportunities than they do
The responses fall into five categories: delegation of responsibility, taking personal
responsibility, ambivalence, fear, and apathy. Over 60% of students delegate responsibility for inequity to the Canadian government. Fewer consider that they want to address
inequity, though this is the second-most popular answer amongst these students. That
over a fifth of students wonder if the inequities faced by Indigenous people are worse
than the ones they face suggests that many of the students in this sample experience
social marginalization of one sort or another, or perhaps it expresses ambivalence.
Another fifth express fear that addressing inequity would entail loss of the advantages
they have (“I fear losing” and “my family has worked hard”). Approximately 10% are
apathetic about inequity (“It is inevitable,” “must move on,” and “does not concern me”).

The prevalence of fear and apathy is particularly indicative of the barriers at play in
challenging systemic racism (Schick & St. Denis, 2003; Tupper, 2013). Yet engagement
with Indigenous people is statistically significant here too. Students who say that inequity
does not concern them are significantly less likely to have had sustained engagement with
Indigenous people, (X2(6, 2869) = 20.61, p = 0.002). The same is true of students who
consider inequity inevitable in any society, (X2(6, 2869) = 19.6, p = 0.003). These results
suggest the social and political importance of engagement with First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit peoples and topics.

Where Students Were Educated
We found that social attitudes were also linked to where students completed their Grade
1–12 education. We asked students where they attended most of their primary and secondary education (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Where students completed the majority of their Grades 1–8 and 9–12
education
The vast majority of students attended school in urban and suburban areas. About a fifth
completed their schooling in small towns. Fewer than 10% were educated in rural areas
and 0.1% of respondents were educated in remote areas. Where students were educated
had no significant effect on test performance, though it did on social attitudes. Chi-square

tests indicated that students who say their immediate family members feel First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit peoples receive privileges are significantly more likely to have completed Grades 1–12 in rural areas (X2(7, 2899) = 42.36, p <0.001) or small towns
(X2(7, 2899) = 33.36, p <0.001). Students who indicated that they did not want to know
about Indigenous peoples and topics are significantly more likely to have completed high
school in cities (X2(7, 2899 = 24.14, p <0.001). That urban students are more closed to
knowing about Indigenous peoples and topics may be linked to longstanding practices of
Indigenous erasure from urban lands (Lawrence, 2004; Peters, 2011).
Where students are attending university also affected test performance. Bearing in
mind that at the time of survey most students were in their first semester, we conducted
independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests to investigate whether test performance
and social attitude varied by university. These yielded significant results. Students at
northern Ontario universities scored significantly higher on the test than students at southern Ontario universities, t(315) = 3.00, p = 0.003. Students attending universities in small
cities or towns (population < 500,000) scored significantly higher than students at universities in large cities, t(2650) = 5.58, p < 0.001. Additionally, students at small universities
(student population < 20,000) scored better than students at large universities, t(2897) =
6.1, p <0.001. Chi-square tests indicated that students attending large, urban universities
are significantly more likely to report that Indigenous peoples and topics never came up
as a topic of conversation at home, (X2(9,2899) = 41.86, p <0.001). These results suggest
that large, urban universities may have the most work to do in enhancing awareness of
Indigenous peoples and topics in their student body.
The analysis presented in this article reflects the knowledge and social attitudes
of university students who graduated from high school before the implementation of the
updated K–8 and Grade 9–12 Canadian and World Studies curricula. Released in 2013
and 2015, respectively, these curricula were designed with input from First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit educators and in many ways are much improved—for example, traditional territories are now discussed. However, over 98% of Indigenous content, including material on the Indian Act and Residential Schools, is optional (Ontario Ministry of

Education, 2013, 2015).3 Making content optional is one way of allowing teachers and
schools to tailor curriculum to their student populations. Yet many Ontario teachers have
themselves not been taught well about colonialism and Indigenous peoples (Dion, 2009;
Higgins, Madden, & Korteweg, 2015; Pratt & Danyluk, 2017). Additionally, the majority
of Ontario faculties of education do not prioritize or mandate Indigenous-focused curriculum or pedagogy across their programs (Nardozi & Mashford-Pringle, 2014; Gallagher-Mackay, Kidder, & Methot, 2013; Waldorf, 2014). As Dion (2012) found in her study
of Métis content in Ontario teacher education programs, despite significant advances in
teacher education, the prevailing attitude amongst non-Indigenous instructors and teacher candidates remains that Métis content is mostly irrelevant outside schools with high
proportions of Métis students. The new curriculum’s placement of Indigenous content in
optional terms thus risks perpetuating the “unequally occupied rhetorical space” fostered
by colonial history and Eurocentric cognitive imperialism and demonstrated by the generation of university students who participated in this Awareness Questionnaire (May, 2006,
p. 110; Battiste, 2013; Code, 1995). This dynamic, together with the findings presented
here, emphasize the necessity of improving teacher education to the point where Indigenous topics, critical perspectives, and worldviews are mandatory for all students’ learning
in Canada. While different regions of Ontario may face different challenges in educating
their students, educational institutions from kindergarten to university have key roles to
play in fostering the critical historical consciousness, mutual respect and ethical stance
central to nation-to-nation relationships (Donald, 2012; Ermine, 2007).

Conclusion
Quantitative results of a knowledge test and associated questionnaire co-designed with
over 200 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit educators across Ontario demonstrate that firstyear university students in the province have been taught ineffectively about colonialism
and its consequences for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples and Canadian society.

At this time, the Ministry of Education has consulted with First Nations and Métis educators and organizations
to revise the updated 2013–15 curricula in response to the TRC’s Calls to Action. These revisions integrate much
more content into mandatory directives and are currently being rolled out across the province for implementation by
school board. The curriculum revisions are still in pre-publication but should be verified and confirmed by the fall
of 2018.

Student Knowledge of Indigenous Peoples

A number of things are clear from this quantitative analysis. Most students are not sufficiently interested to take part in a questionnaire on Indigenous topics on their own time.
While students are most aware of topics in the news, many know remarkably little about
the history of Indigenous–settler relations in Canada or about contemporary Indigenous
presence and vitality. Students have little sense of the systemic nature and ongoing consequences of colonial violence. Many do not see Indigenous people as part of Canadian
society, and the vast majority do not understand the roots of Indigenous rights and take an
uncritical approach to Canadian governance. Overwhelmingly, students seem to believe
that wherever Indigenous people are, they are not here; not present and by implication not
relevant to their daily lives. This perceived absence is deeply political, as it works to limit
points of connection to the longstanding efforts of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people
and governments to engage residents of Canada in respectful relations (Ermine, 2007;
de Costa & Clark, 2016; Donald, 2012). While the Indigenous students who participated
in this survey could and did turn to family and Indigenous persons for their knowledge,
non-Indigenous students often rely on formal education and media. Non-Indigenous
students’ poor performance on the knowledge test highlights the breadth of the gap
between what is taught in formal education—through curriculum content and pedagogical
approaches—and the knowledge considered important by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
people in Ontario. However, when students have opportunities to learn from Indigenous
people(s), knowledge systems and topics, and when we expect students to engage, care,
and be accountable to this relationship core to Canada, it can make a significant difference to what students know and think. We will be returning to Ontario universities in
2018 to survey the exiting student cohort. We will conduct at least some of these surveys in classes to increase response rates and engage students in dialogue and reflection.
Qualitative results from this 2014 study (forthcoming) and results from surveys of exiting
students will further enhance the analysis of student learning presented here.
