His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies:  [[Native]]  Peoples, the

WAR i.V. GREAT L?iKES
by Canada and the  [[United States]]
The appointment of William Johnson in  [[1755]]  as His
Britannic Majesty's "Sole Agent for and Superintendent of the
Affairs of our faithful subjects and allies, the six united Nations
of  [[Indian]] s and their Confederates in the  [[North]] ern  Parts of
 [[North]]  America ," created a formal, imperial and centralized
 [[Indian]]  Department to direct the affairs of  [[Native]]  peoples on
behalf of the  [[British]]   [[Crown]] .1 Prior to the pivotal in [[flu]] ence of
the regime of Sir William Johnson ( [[1755]] -74),  [[Indian]]  affairs in
colonial America had been marked by a long, vexing and
generally rudderless period of imperial "salutary neglect."
Inter-colonial land rivalries and wrangling disunity had only
further complicated  [[British]] - [[Indian]]  relations which  [[flu]] ctuated
between the benign and the intolerable. But by the  [[1750]] s, the
looming and final conflict with  [[France]]  for paramountcy in
 [[North]]  America  turned  [[British]]  vacillation into resolve. The
appointment by royal commission of a single  [[Crown]]  official for
the administration and management of  [[Indian]]  Affairs was
therefore a sensible and long overdue imperial initiative.
Finally, after one hundred and fifty years of permanent  [[British]]
settlement along the eastern shores of the "new world" a formal
and centralized policy for the  [[indigenous]]  or  [[Native]]  peoples had
emanated from  [[Britain]] . The cohesive vehicle for implementing
the policy directives was the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department, the
forerunner of the present Department of  [[Indian]]  and  [[North]] ern
Affairs Canada. Until the end of the  War  of  [[1812]] , the
fundamental and motivating tenet of the policy was to court

and maintain the allegiance of the  [[Native]]  peoples to the royal
cause. As a result, and especially in the post- [[1774]]  years against
the common enemy (the  [[American]] s), an enduring and symbiotic
relationship evolved between the  [[Native]]  peoples and the  [[British]]
 [[Crown]]  which was rooted in the mutual need and desire for
"protection and survival."2  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy from  [[1774]]  to
 [[1815]]  was thus geared to ensure the preservation and defense of
Canada through the military use and assistance of "His
Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies."
The  [[Native]]  peoples were not duped by this  [[British]]  scheme,
and demonstrated an equal shrewdness in manipulating  [[Crown]]
officials in order to preserve traditional tribal lands and
culture. Yet the fundamental and significant difference was that
the  [[British]]  manipulated successfully. Perhaps the  [[Indian]] s faced
a hopeless task in attempting to stem the tide of the frontier.
Nonetheless, the results were conclusive, for while the Iroquois
lost their ancient castles along the Finger Lakes of Upper New
York, and later the tribes of the Ohio Valley were foresaken, the
 [[British]] , by securing invaluable  [[Indian]]  assistance, defeated the
 [[French]]  and then, more particularly, defended successfully the
 [[Crown]] 's interest in  [[British]]   [[North]]  America  from the  [[American]]
invaders of  [[1812]] .
The success of  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy during the pre- War  of
 [[1812]]  years can be demonstrated by detailing a few examples.
Throughout the Seven Years'  War , for instance, Johnson
managed to retain the loyalty of the  [[Mohawk]]  and others of the
Six Nations Confederacy of Iroquois in the conflict between
 [[Britain]]  and  [[France]]  for imperial supremacy in  [[North]]  America .
His nominal victory at the  [[battle]]  of Lake George in  [[September]]
 [[1755]]  against the  [[French]]  regulars of Baron Dieskau, held the
wavering Iroquois neutral for nearly three years, in spite of
subsequent  [[French]]  successes at Fort Bull and Oswego in  [[1756]] ,
Fort William Henry in  [[1757]] , and Ticonderoga in  [[1758]] . But a
 [[British]]  resurgence, exemplified by a smashing victory of
Johnson's loyal Iroquois at the  [[battle]]  of La Belle Famille near
2 This theme to the Royal Proclamation of  [[1763]]  is detailed in Jack

Fort Niagara in  [[July]]   [[1759]]  against a  [[French]]  relief column,
coupled with the fall of  [[Quebec]]  two months later, ended  [[French]]
imperial ambitions in  [[North]]  America .
In  [[April]]   [[1775]] , less than a year after the  [[death]]  of Sir William
Johnson, the 'shots heard round the world' at Lexington and
Concord initiated a cruel and bitter civil war and  [[rebellion]]  in
colonial America. Once again, the military support of  [[Native]]
peoples was vital to the  [[Crown]] 's vested interest in America.
 [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy was successful during these years in large
measure because of the several tribes that had long opposed the
intrusion into their lands of their hereditary foe, the  [[American]]
backwoodsman.  [[Native]]  peoples were thus thrown into a natural
military  [[alliance]]  with the  [[British]]   [[Crown]] , and against the
common enemy.
Yet at the peace negotiations of  [[1783]] ,  [[British]]  pleni
potentiaries "sold the  [[Indian]] s to  [[Congress]] " and transferred
 [[sovereignty]]  of all  [[Indian]] ?held lands south of the Great Lakes
and west of the Mississippi River, to the new  [[United States]] ?
the first abandonment.5 The warriors were "thunderstruck."
They had not lost their war nor their land. Indeed in  [[June]]  and
 [[August]]   [[1782]] , the  [[Indian]] s had won two successive and decisive
victories at Sandusky and Blue Licks against the  [[American]] s. In
the latter engagement, the legendary Daniel Boone of
Kentucky was among the routed.7 Following some hasty
rethinking, prompted by the fear of  [[Indian]]  reprisals, the  [[British]]
decided to retain the eastern posts; and the warriors, now
encouraged and supplied by His Majesty's  [[government]] ,
continued the struggle to preserve and defend  [[aboriginal]]  lands.

finally collapsed at the  [[battle]]  of Fallen Timbers in  [[August]]   [[1794]] .
At this critical moment, the  [[British]]  at nearby Fort Miami,
despite the most avowed promises to the contrary, slammed
shut the gates of the fort, and assumed a lofty position of
splendid isolation.8 The formalization of the Jay  [[Treaty]]  with
the  [[American]]  republic soon after stipulated in part the removal
of the  [[British]]  from the western post by  [[June]]   [[1796]] . Joseph
Brant, the  [[Mohawk]]  chief and Loyalist, tersely summarized the
situation by stating that "this is the second time the poor
 [[Indian]] s have been left in the lurch."
 [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy between  [[1775]]  and  [[1796]]  had been
effective and coldly calculating. The new Loyalist settlements
north of the lakes and rivers at Amherstburg, Sandwich,
Newark, Quinte and along the upper St. Lawrence, protected as
they had been for thirteen years by a convenient  [[Indian]]  barrier,
prospered and gained a measure of security, while to the south,
warriors fought and  [[died]] , not to preserve and defend  [[British]]
Canada, but in a vain attempt to retain ancient tribal lands.
Between  [[1796]]  and  [[1807]]  the in [[flu]] ence and prestige of the
 [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department waned to insignificance as the
 [[Indian]] s were no longer needed as military allies. During these
quiet years, expenditures were drastically reduced, and the
department was re-organized. In a "Plan for the Future
Government of the  [[Indian]]  Department" in  [[June]]   [[1796]] , the
position of Superintendent of  [[Indian]]  Affairs was established for
each of the replacement forts in Upper Canada.11 As a result,

for instance, Matthew Elliott was appointed superintendent for
the new  [[British]]  post at Amherstburg. Although the traditional
military role of the department had reached a nadir at this
time, the superintendents were nonetheless instructed to "use
the utmost diligence to preserve and promote friendship
between the troops and  [[Indian]] s... and to maintain harmony
at the  [[King]] 's (new) posts."12 The wisdom of attempting to
maintain the chain of friendship  [[alliance]]  proved prophetic. The
"Chesapeake Affair" of  [[June]]   [[1807]]  and the bellicose reaction by
an aroused  [[American]]  public for a redemption of national honor
produced a fear of invasion in the weakly defended settlement
of the Canadas. In particular, the position of Upper Canada was
precarious because the defensive strategy devised by the
 [[British]] , already heavily burdened with the Napoleonic war, was
to preserve the fortress of  [[Quebec]]  and subordinate all other
considerations. Once again, the future security, and even
survival, of Upper Canada was to be largely dependent on the
allegiance and fighting qualities of His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies.
As a result, the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department was quickly
restored to a respectful position of prominence as it was to play
an integral role in combating this new danger.
During the winter of  [[1807]] -08, Sir James Craig, the captain
general and governor-in-chief of  [[British]]   [[North]]  America ,
developed a policy for the frontier which was to guide the
conduct of the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department for the next three
hectic years. Craig reasoned that in the event of a war, the
 [[Indian]] s would not be idle, and if the  [[British]]  did not use them,
they undoubtedly would be "employed against us."13 Therefore,
the  [[Indian]] s must be conciliated, but their chiefs must be
persuaded not to engage in a premature attack on the
 [[American]] s. Thus, cautioned Craig, the officers of the  [[Indian]]
Department should avoid making any commitment with them
at least in public. In a dispatch to a worried Francis Gore, the
lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, Craig noted the "long
lasting ties" between the  [[King]]  and the tribes, and suggested
Matthew Elliott:  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Agent (Detroit: Wayne State  [[University]] ,
 [[1964]] ).

that provisions be supplied to the  [[Indian]] s to enable them to
protect themselves against the  [[American]] s who "obviously
desired to take their country."14 Craig ordered that "the officers
of the  [[Indian]]  Department must be diligent and active, the
communications must be constant, these [[top]]ics must be held up
to them not merely in Great Councils and public assemblies,
they should be privately urged to some of their leading men,
with whom endeavours should be used to lead them to a
confidence with us."
The dual  [[Indian]]  policy of Craig, one public and one private,
was very reminiscent of the immediate post- [[1783]]  efforts. As
before, the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department was to renew the old
courtship rituals, and secure  [[Indian]]  loyalty to the  [[King]] , and
thus preserve  [[British]]  imperial and territorial jurisdiction in
Upper Canada by confounding the expansionist ambitions of the
 [[United States]] . Gore was enthusiastic about the plan and sent
William Claus, the deputy superintendent general of  [[Indian]]
Affairs, to the  [[British]]  post at Amherstburg, the key  [[Indian]]
center in the province, where he was to assemble the chiefs,
"consult privately" with them and remind them of the "Artful
and Clandestine manner, in which the  [[American]] s have obtained
possession of their lands, and of their obvious intention of
ultimately possessing themselves of the whole and driving the
 [[Indian]] s out of the Country."16 However, the officers of the
department were reminded to dissuade the tribes from any
warlike action until or unless Britian should be at war with the
 [[United States]] .
In the spring of  [[1808]]  several  [[Indian]]  bands began to assemble
at Amherstburg to hear the  [[British]]  speak in council. For the
officers of the  [[Indian]]  Department, the implementation of
Craig's policy required delicate and intricate negotiations,
particularly since "the  [[Indian]]  Nations owing to the long
continuance of Peace have been neglected by us, and from the
considerable curtailments made in the Presents to those People
it appears, that the retaining of their attachment to the  [[King]] 's

Interests has not of late years been thought an object worthy of
serious consideration."17 As a consequence, William Claus,
Matthew Elliott and others, worked diligently to regain the
affections of the  [[Indian]] s. In one council, a Shawnee contingent
under Captain Johnny, Blackbeard, and the Buffalo, was told
that the  [[King]]  was trying to maintain peace with the
 [[American]] s, but if he failed, the  [[Indian]] s could expect to hear
from the  [[British]]  and together they would regain the country
taken from them by the  [[American]] s. Heartened by this news,
 [[Indian]]  warriors and chiefs, including the in [[flu]] ential Shawnee
leader Tecumseh who, like Pontiac and Joseph Brant before
him, dreamed of a united  [[Indian]]  confederacy, gathered in
increasing numbers at Amherstburg to meet with the  [[British]] .
Although the innocuous public councils were conducted with
great decorum, formality, and military pomp, the private
communications with select chiefs (the backroom politics of the
day) were where the real strategy was formulated and
entrenched. Yet, in spite of the different  [[Indian]]  Nations
collecting on the Wabash to preserve their country from any
encroachments, the tribes remained somewhat wary of promised
 [[British]]  support. In fact, Major-General Isaac Brock noted that
"before we can expect an active co-operation on the part of the
 [[Indian]] s the reduction of Detroit and Michilimackinac must
convince that people, who conceive themselves to have been
sacrificed in  [[1794]] , to our policy, that we are earnestly engaged
in the war."18 In spite of these justifiable  [[Indian]]  concerns, the
efforts of the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department in renewing the chain
of friendship at Amherstburg was an unqualified success.
For the next two years tribal delegates constantly visited the
 [[British]]  at Amherstburg to pledge their support to the  [[King]]  and
to receive gifts and provisions in return. The department,
receiving no instructions to the contrary, continued to win and
maintain the allegiance of the various tribes. By the summer of
 [[1810]] ,  [[Indian]]  frustration and anger at  [[American]]  encroachments
on their lands and  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department inspiration,
combined to make the  [[Indian]]  appetite for war increasingly

difficult to control. In  [[July]] , a Sauk and Fox delegation arrived
at Amherstburg and requested clothing, kettles, muskets, shot,
and powder. In council, Elliott urged the  [[Indian]] s to "keep your
eyes fixed on me; my tomahawk is now up; be you ready, but do
not strike until I give the signal."19 This speech exhilarated the
tribes who were now most enthusiastic about the prospects of a
new  [[British]] - [[Indian]]   [[alliance]]  against the common enemy. In
 [[November]] , 2,000 Shawnee, Sauk, Winnebago,  [[Ottawa]] , and
Potawatomi gathered at Amherstburg for a grand council.
Tecumseh acted as spokesman for the tribes and informed the
 [[British]]  that "we are now determined to defend it [their land]
ourselves, and after raising you on your feet leave you behind
but expecting you will push forward towards us what may be
necessary to supply our wants."
The officers of the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department were astounded
by these words. Elliott wrote Claus stating that "our
Neighbours are on the eve of an  [[Indian]]   War , and I have no
doubt that the Confederacy is almost general."21 The  [[November]]
council had placed the  [[British]]  in a difficult and embarrassing
position. The policy of  [[1808]]  had been too successful. Now the
great problem for the department was to prevent the over
zealous  [[Indian]] s from attacking the  [[American]] s before the official
declaration of war between Great  [[Britain]]  and the United
States. In a desperate attempt to reverse policy, the department
was instructed to dissuade the tribes from their projected plan
of hostility. The chiefs were to understand clearly that they
"must not expect any assistance" from the  [[British]] .22 By the
summer of  [[1811]]  the officers of the  [[Indian]]  Department were
striving frantically to stall the  [[Indian]]  war by attempting to
convince various in [[flu]] ential chiefs that the time was not ripe.
But the  [[Indian]] s' desire for war was unshakable and sporadic
raids commenced against the  [[American]]  settlements along the
Wabash River. The  [[American]] s deduced that  [[British]]  intrigue

and instigation was behind the revival of  [[Indian]]  resistance and
 [[Indian]] - [[American]]  and Anglo- [[American]]  relations rapidly
deteriorated. Following the  [[battle]]  of Tippecanoe on 7  [[November]]
 [[1811]]  in which " [[British]]  muskets were found on the  [[battle]] field,"
the  [[American]] s charged that "the whole of the  [[Indian]] s on this
frontier have been completely armed and equipped out of the
king's stores" at Amherstburg.23 A war between the  [[Indian]] s,
 [[American]] s and  [[British]]  now appeared certain.
For several months, prior to Tippecanoe, the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]
Department had made genuine efforts to prevent an  [[Indian]]  war,
but the vacillation of policy and the long delays in
communicating often different instructions had hampered the
effectiveness of the department and confused the visiting chiefs.
The only alter[[native]] was the renewal of the traditional
friendship and military  [[alliance]]  as revived in  [[1808]] . Therefore,
throughout the spring of  [[1812]] , following the latest instructions
of using "your utmost endeavours to promote His Majesty's
 [[Indian]]  Interest in general," the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department
secretly prepared the tribes for war.24 By  [[June]]  of  [[1812]]  when the
 [[United States]]  finally declared war on Great  [[Britain]]  and
proceeded to invade Upper Canada, the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]
Department, probably relieved at receiving the news, was
waiting at Amherstburg with an impatient host of  [[Indian]]
warriors for the commencement of military action.
Nowhere was the success of the long-standing and evolving
 [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy better demonstrated than during the  War
of  [[1812]] . From the moment hostilities commenced, the fighting
efforts of His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies were generally successful,
particularly during the first few critical summer months of
 [[1812]] , as evidenced by a series of  [[Indian]]  inspired victories at
such places as Michilimackinac and along the Detroit River at
Brownston, Maguaga (Monguagon) and Detroit.25 The  [[Native]]
leaders came from many tribes and regions of the Great Lakes.

Roundhead, Walk-in-the-Water and Split Log were Wyandot,
formerly known as the  [[Huron]]  of Detroit; Main Poc was a
Potawatomi; Neywash, an  [[Ottawa]] ; Tomah, a Menonomee; Black
Hawk, a Sauk from the upper Mississippi; and there were many
others. Yet Tecumseh, a Shawnee, emerged as the individual of
dominant authority and in [[flu]] ence among the tribes.
Subsequently glamorized in poetry and prose by non-[[native]]
writers, especially  [[Canadian]] , Tecumseh possessed no particular
love nor loyalty to Canada.27 His sole interest was to establish a
strong pan- [[Indian]]  movement and resist the  [[American]] s who
were coveting the traditional lands of the  [[Native]]  peoples. Thus
during the  War  of  [[1812]] , the warriors used the necessary
convenience of a formal military  [[alliance]]  with the  [[British]] ,
 [[flu]] ng themselves against the common enemy, and in the process
fought magnificently, if unwittingly, in the defense of the
 [[British]]   [[Crown]]  in Canada. In  [[January]]   [[1813]] , Roundhead, with
Wyandot and others of His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies, spearheaded
a smashing and bloody  [[British]] - [[Indian]]  victory over the
 [[American]] s at the River Raisin ( [[French]] town), now Monroe,
Michigan.28 The  [[kill]] ing of some  [[American]] s wounded after the
 [[battle]]  by warriors, an event neither unique nor rare for both
sides in the annals of frontier warfare in America, merely
heightened the intensity and determination of the combatants.
Near Fort Meigs along the Maumee River in  [[May]] , Tecumseh
caught a reinforcement of Kentucky volunteers in the woods,
and virtually  [[slaughtered]]  them. Yet, at Fort Stephenson along
the Sandusky River in  [[August]] , the warriors decided to assume
the role of spectators, and watched  [[British]]  regulars destroy

themselves in futile charges against the formidable enemy
defenses.
But with the  [[American]]  naval victory at Put-in-Bay on Lake
Erie in  [[September]]   [[1813]] , the  [[British]]  position at Fort Maiden
(Amherstburg) became untenable. The tactical decision to
withdraw from the region, owing to the fact that the  [[American]] s
now controlled Lake Erie and could play havoc with  [[British]]
logistics, especially provisioning, was vehemently opposed by
the chiefs and warriors, who remembered  [[1783]]  and  [[1794]] . To the
 [[Native]]  peoples, the  [[British]]  departure was also a symbolic
abandonment of  [[Indian]]  territorial interests, and thus
represented a third betrayal. A few days later on 5  [[October]]
 [[1813]] , at Moravian Town on the Thames River,  [[representative]] s of
many tribes? Shawnee,  [[Ottawa]] , Ojibwa, Potawatomi, Wyandot
(those who hadn't defected), Delaware, Sauk, Fox, Winnebago
and even some  [[Cree]] k from the south, stood grimly with
Tecumseh; and possibly feeling that courage and defiance were
their only remaining true allies, faced for a final time the ever
advancing ancient enemy. The  [[battle]]  was brief and furious. The
41st Regiment of Foot (later the Welch Regiment), physically
exhausted after fourteen months of almost continuous and
arduous campaigning against much superior forces, at least in
numbers, uncharacteristically broke ranks after firing two
ragged volleys, and surrendered or dispersed.30 His Majesty's
 [[Indian]]  Allies, positioned in the swamps and woods to the right
of the  [[British]]  position, continued to contest the  [[battle]]  for a
time, before stubbornly, but in good order, giving way. Tecumseh
was slain; and with him ended the dream of a united  [[Indian]]
resistance against the territorial ambitions of the  [[United States]]
in the lower Great Lakes region.

Although His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies faded from the scene
along the Detroit front, following the Battle of the Thames,
what ended in one area, had just begun in another. This second
front? the  [[North]] west? merits some considerable attention,
for important events took place there which are too little
known, and which could have altered dramatically the future
geographic boundaries of Canada and the  [[United States]] . Again,
His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies were prominent.
 [[British]]  paramountcy in the upper Mississippi and the  [[North]]
west depended on the military allegiance of the  [[Indian]]  tribes of
that vast region. The  [[British]]  and  [[Indian]]  capture of Michilimac
kinac; and the Potawatomi massacre of Fort Dearborn (Chicago)
in the summer of  [[1812]]  had "opened the northern hive" of In
dians against the  [[American]] s.32 Equally important, the zealous
activities of the officers of the  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department and
several prominent  [[Canadian]]  fur  [[trade]] rs in courting and main
taining the  [[alliance]]  with the tribes had resulted in a " [[British]] "
domination in the  [[North]] west which remained unchallenged
until the late spring of  [[1814]] .
In  [[May]]  of that year, an  [[American]]  force from St. Louis under
General William Clark, governor of Missouri Territory, ascended
the Mississippi and, meeting only token resistance from the
Sauk and Fox, took possession of Prairie du Chien. After con
structing a stockade which he named Fort Shelby and content
with his success, Clark returned to St. Louis. He left a small
garrison of about seventy men under Lieutenant Joseph Per
kins of the Twenty-Fourth  [[United States]]  Infantry to guard the
village and the new post. The news of the  [[American]]  presence in
the upper Mississippi stung the  [[British]]  commandant at
Michilimackinac, Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall. He
reacted immediately by dispatching a force "to dislodge the

 [[American]]  General from his new conquest, and make him relin
quish the immense tract of country he had seized upon in conse
quence and which brought him into the very heart of that oc
cupied by our friendly  [[Indian]] s." Although his own position was
weak, McDouall was fully cognizant of the critical threat posed
by the  [[American]] s at Prairie du Chien to  [[British]]  military
hegemony and  [[Canadian]]  fur  [[trade]]  interests in the  [[North]] west. If
the enemy was not removed from the area "there was an end to
our connection with the  [[Indian]] s... tribe after tribe would be
graned [sic] over or subdued, and thus would be destroyed the
only barrier which protects the Great trading establishments of
the  [[North]]   [[West]]  and the  [[Hudson's Bay]]  Company."
In late  [[June]] , an expedition under Lt. Col. William McKay
was dispatched to Prairie du Chien. They were joined en route
by voyageurs, Green Bay militia, and a horde of  [[Indian]] s. McKay
was singularly unimpressed with the tribal allies and com
mented upon his arrival in front of Fort Shelby that his contin
gent had swelled to 650 men, of whom 120 were  [[Canadian]]  Vol
unteers, Michigan Fencibles, and officers of the  [[Indian]]  Depart
ment, the remainder  [[Indian]] s who proved to be "perfectly use
less."35 The small  [[American]]  fort containing two blockhouses
and six pieces of cannon was situated on a hill overlooking the
village. A large gunboat, the  [[Governor]]  Clark, was anchored in
the middle of the Mississippi River. This floating blockhouse,
 [[immune]]  from the effects of musket fire, mounted fourteen can
non and had a crew of eighty men. It was constructed so that
the men on board could row swiftly in any direction. The unex
pected appearance of McKay and his mixed force on Sunday, 17
 [[July]] , caught the  [[American]] s by surprise. It was a pleasant day
and the officers were preparing to take a pleasure ride and
enjoy an outing in the country. After a dramatic exchange of
notes, Perkins concluded by stating that he preferred to defend
to the last man rather than surrender. This produced a three
hour barrage against the fort and gunboat. The  [[American]] s re
turned the fire. The  [[Governor]]  Clark, leaking and taking casual
ties, withdrew down river. For the next two days McKay con

ducted siege operations. Two breastworks were constructed, and
"a constant but perfectly useless" musket fire was maintained
against the fort. Some of the  [[Indian]] s "behaved in a most villan
ous manner" and plundered the inhabitants in the village. On
19  [[July]] , McKay "resolved to accomplish something more deci
sive," and marched his troops into the recently completed works
and prepared red hot shot for the cannon. The  [[American]] s, see
ing "that a severe assault of some kind was about to be made,
raised the  white  flag." By the terms of the capitulation, McKay
took possession of the fort, several pieces of cannon, military
and camp equipment, and a large quantity of ammunition and
foodstuffs. The surrendered garrison was permitted to retire un
molested in boats down river to St. Louis. McKay was pleased
with the Michigan Fencibles who "behaved with great courage,
coolness and regularity," and "tho in the midst of a hot fire not
a man was even wounded." Indeed, purred McKay, "all acted
with that courage and activity so becoming  [[Canadian]]  Militia or
Volunteers."
Two days after the success at Fort Shelby, the  [[Indian]] s, whose
military prowess had been so recently maligned by McKay, won
a crushing victory over the  [[American]] s at Rock Island rapids, a
few miles south of Prairie du Chien. This  [[American]]  force of
about 120 regulars and rangers under the command of Major
John Campbell, and unaware of the recent developments, was
arriving in six keelboats to reinforce the garrison at Fort
Shelby. Near the  [[Indian]]  villages scattered along the banks of
the Rock River, about 400 Sauk, Fox and Kickapoo attacked and
severely mauled the relief column. The  [[Indian]] s fought with a
fierce intensity and, desperate to protect their villages and
 [[property]] , "the women even jumped on board with hoes and some
breaking heads, others breaking casks, some trying to cut holes
in her bottom to sink her, and others setting fire to her
decks."37 About fifty  [[American]] s were  [[kill]] ed and wounded in the
engagement. Joined by the timely arrival of the  [[Governor]]
Clark, Campbell and his remnant made a precipitate retreat to
St. Louis. A jubilant McKay reported that "this is perhaps one
of the most brilliant actions fought by  [[Indian]] s only since the
commencement of the war."

The twin victories at Prairie du Chien and the Rock Island
Rapids in  [[July]] , coupled with the successful defense of
Michilimackinac in  [[August]] , reasserted and confirmed  [[British]]
superiority in the  [[North]] west. In the Upper Mississippi, McKay
crowned his success in a symbolic sense by modestly renaming
Fort Shelby, Fort McKay. He then promptly retired to his quar
ters for he had developed "a swelling on the right side of the
head" and "a violent fever." In fact he was suffering from a se
vere case of the mumps. He soon recovered and departed for
Michilimackinac.
His successor at Fort McKay was Captain Thomas Gummer
sall (Tige) Anderson, the commander of the Mississippi Volun
teers. As post commandant, Anderson strengthened Fort McKay
and built a northeast blockhouse. He worried about the poor
harvest that year, and because of the want of provisions, he or
dered the Mississippi Volunteers to help the local farmers in
getting in the grain. The troops were also kept occupied per
forming daily garrison duties. There were few diversions, except
for excessive rum drinking and watching the occasional exciting
spectacle of inter-tribal lacrosse in which several participants
usually "got sore wounds from the ball and the hurl stick."
In late summer a second and larger  [[American]]  expedition of
350 men and eight gunboats under the command of Major
Zachary Taylor, future president of the  [[United States]] , was
launched against the  [[Indian]]  villages along the Rock River.
About 1,200 Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, Winnebago, and Sioux under
the leadership of Black Hawk, the Sauk and "zealous partisan
of the  [[British]]  cause," assembled to meet the  [[American]]  threat.
Fully aware of these events, Anderson dispatched Duncan
Graham of the  [[Indian]]  Department and thirty men, and James
Keating of the Royal Artillery with two swivel-guns and a 3
pounder to bolster  [[Indian]]  courage. In the early morning of 5
 [[September]] , the  [[Indian]] s and  [[Canadian]] s attacked Taylor's flotilla
at Rock Island. The accuracy of the guns under Keating which
was "base enough to knock the Splinters into the men's faces"
in the gunboats, and the confidence of the  [[Indian]] s who "raised
a yell and commenced firing on us in every direction," con
vinced Taylor of the futility of attempting to destroy the  [[Indian]]

villages and  [[corn]]  fields, and of pushing north to Prairie du
Chien.40 With the  [[Indian]] s in pursuit for nearly three miles, the
 [[American]] s retreated down river. They had suffered about fifteen
 [[kill]] ed and wounded.  [[Indian]]  casualties were considered negligi
ble. At the entrance of the Des Moines River, Taylor built Fort
Johnson. In  [[October]] , this last vestige of an  [[American]]  presence
in the upper Mississippi was burned, and the garrison retired to
St. Louis. No further military efforts were made against Rock
Island or Prairie du Chien.
By the late autumn at Fort McKay, rations were becoming
scarce. To alleviate the food shortage, Anderson discharged the
Green Bay militia and sent them home. The remaining troops
received  [[corn]]  one day, flour and pork the next. Of greater con
cern was the increasing number of  [[Indian]]  families who were
camping around Prairie du Chien awaiting the arrival of the
annual supplies from the  [[Indian]]  Department. These problems
remained unsolved when Anderson was finally relieved of his
temporary command on 30  [[November]]   [[1814]] . His dedication and
abilities were proven, and he remained at Fort McKay in local
command of the .Michigan Fencibles. Andrew Bulger, a New
foundlander, took command of Fort McKay on this last day of
 [[November]] , his twenty-fifth birthday.41 The situation was both
dangerous and delicate as the new commandant had inherited
the twin problems of garrison discontent and tribal irritation at
the scarcity of provisions. The troops were bored and insolent.
They were now existing mainly on a scanty allowance of bread
and a ration of "wild meat" when available. Determined to pre
serve order, Bulger began to instill a sense of pride and discip
line in his men. This goal was achieved in early  [[January]]   [[1815]] ,
when he quickly suppressed a near mutiny among the
Michigan Fencibles and flogged the three worst offenders.
Thereafter the corps assumed a more steadfast military bear
ing.

In addition, Bulger was instructed to "cultivate a good under
standing" with the  [[Indian]]  tribes and maintain their allegiance
to the  [[British]] . Throughout the winter of  [[1814]] -15, his duties
were "as unceasing as they were arduous," and he succeeded in
gaining the continued affection of the  [[Indian]] s by visiting sev
eral of their villages.43 Unfortunately he also became embroiled
in a bitter feud with Robert Dickson, Agent and Superintendent
to the  [[West]] ern  [[Indian]] s, over the control and feeding of the In
dian allies. Dickson had been prominent in the fur  [[trade]]  for
thirty years before the war, and he was the senior officer of the
 [[British]]   [[Indian]]  Department in the  [[North]] west. He was married
to a Sioux woman and was genuinely concerned at the destitute
condition of the  [[Indian]] s, apart from their military value. Rela
tions between the two men became increasingly strained over
specific areas of responsibility. Dickson insisted that supplies to
the  [[Indian]] s must be increased and he showed a bias in feeding
the Sioux bands. Bulger endeavored "to promote a fair, equal
and judicious distribution" of provisions and gifts to the  [[Indian]]
families, and he refused to allow the  [[Indian]]  Department to
usurp his authority or that of the  [[British]]  army.44 He reported to
McDouall that the conduct of Dickson had placed the garrison
and other western  [[Indian]]  allies in danger of further starvation.
The feud became petty and degenerated into name-calling.
McDouall fully supported Bulger, and in one letter he referred
to Dickson as that "insidious, intriguing, dangerous, yet despic
able character."45 This nastiness was terminated when
McDouall finally ordered that "the  [[Indian]]  Department on the
Mississippi is subject to and entirely under the orders of Cap
tain Bulger."46 In  [[April]]   [[1815]]  Dickson was ordered to
Michilimackinac. This whole episode, coupled with the boredom
and isolation of Prairie du Chien, so disgusted Duncan Graham
that "was there not favourable appearances to the termination
of this drudgery," he reckoned that "he would throw up in
stantly." The disconsolate Graham proved prophetic when he
wrote:

Here we are posted since last fall, without news from any
quarter, and destitute of provisions, sociability, harmony or
good understanding. Not even a glass of grog, nor a pipe of
 [[tobacco]] , to pass away the time, and if a brief period don't
bring a change for the better, I much dread the united
 [[Irish]] men's wish will befall this place which god forbid it
should? a bad Winter, a worse Spring, a bloody Summer,
and no  [[King]] .47
In fact official news of peace reached Prairie du Chien in the
late spring of  [[1815]] . Strong war-parties to threaten St. Louis,
and "keep the  [[American]] s at home to defend that place" had al
ready been dispatched. In these raids the  [[Indian]] s "took more
scalps within the last six weeks than they did during the whole
of the preceding spring and summer upon this frontier."48
Bulger immediately recalled the warriors. As the basis of the
peace  [[treaty]]  was status quo ante bellum, the "mutual restora
tion of all forts" became a priority. At Michilimackinac,
McDouall was "penetrated with grief at the restoration of this
fine Island, a fortress built by Nature for herself." He was
"equally mortified at giving up Fort McKay to the  [[American]] s,"
but there was no alter[[native]] but compliance. The crestfallen
McDouall concluded by observing that "our negotiators as
usual, have been egregiously duped... they have shown them
selves profoundly ignorant of the concerns of this part of the
Empire."49 At Fort McKay on 23  [[May]] , Bulger assembled the
chiefs for a grand council and explained the terms of the peace.
Black Hawk, that "whole hearted man and unflinching warrior,
cried like a  [[child]]  saying our Great Mother [Great  [[Britain]] ] has
thus concluded, and further talk is useless." Two days later,
after distributing presents to the tribes and leaving them
"above want," His Majesty's troops gathered their possessions,
burned the fort and departed the upper Mississippi forever. Of

pation of Prairie du Chien, was that all three post commanders
and most of the garrison, were  [[Canadian]] s.50
In the  [[North]] west, the  War  of  [[1812]]  was a very different matter
than the one played out along the Detroit. When the United
States went to war in  [[June]]   [[1812]]  to redress national honor and
capture Canada, an early territorial ambition which anticipated
the  [[American]]  vision of manifest destiny for the continent, the
key consideration for Upper Canada was defense. The concept of
'Manifest Destiny,' replete with spiritual and religious connota
tions, was used by the  [[United States]]  to justify that westward
sweeping movement in which successive  [[Indian]]  frontiers were
 [[conquer]] ed and pacified. It was God's will, apparently, that
 [[American]] s must dominate and control  [[North]]  America . The sug
gestion that the  [[United States]]  usurped a large part of the conti
nent by purchase, war and theft, is too harsh. But, an argument
could be made that the zealous young republic dispossessed
tribe after tribe during the long epic years of ' [[West]] ward Ho;'
and it did so by taking thousands upon thousands of hectares or
acres of unceded  [[Indian]]  lands, to which no consideration, recog
nition nor acknowledgement was given that these  [[indigenous]]
peoples might have at least the benefit of the right of prior oc
cupancy or  [[aboriginal]]  title, as they had enjoyed the use and oc
cupancy of their lands since time immemorial.
Manifest Destiny proved most successful for the expansionist
ambitions of the  [[United States]] , except, of course, in the case of
Canada during the  War  of  [[1812]] . The failure to take Canada was
a rare exception through these many years in which  [[American]]
destiny did not manifest. Yet  [[American]] s were mollified, for they
did win the  [[Indian]]  war in the  War  of  [[1812]] , as Tecumseh's Con
federacy was irretrievably crushed and the Great Lakes  [[Indian]]
frontier secured. But the  War  of  [[1812]]  also provided the pros
pects for a little  [[Canadian]]  manifest destiny. In the  [[North]] west, a
number of prominent  [[Canadian]]  fur  [[trade]] rs, supported by the
 [[Indian]]  tribes of the upper Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley,
also viewed, in their way, the  War  of  [[1812]]  as an opportunity to
grasp and consolidate territory. For these two groups, the war
became a common struggle to achieve a possible permanent
 [[British]]  hegemony in that hinterland and thus preserve the fur
 [[trade]]  and the traditional  [[Indian]]  way of life against  [[American]]
50 Allen, " [[Canadian]] s on the Upper Mississippi," 118.

expansion and settlement. His Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies and the
 [[Canadian]] s won their war but lost the peace, and with it, a
chance to grab at destiny; for at Ghent,  [[British]]  negotiators sac
rificed  [[Indian]]  and  [[Canadian]]  ambitions in the  [[North]] west for a
renewed Anglo- [[American]]  cordiality.
The post- [[1815]]  years indeed produced an "Era of Good Feel
ings" between  [[Britain]] , Canada and America, and a number of
councils took place at Fort McKay, Amherstburg, Drummond Is
land and other  [[Indian]]  Department posts in which  [[British]]  offi
cials "distinctly and explicitly" informed the assembled war
riors that His Majesty's  [[government]]  would no longer assist nor
countenance the tribes in any hostile actions against the United
States. Further, the warriors were counseled to bury the
hatchet, plant  [[corn]]  and be content. "I rubbed my eyes and
cleared my ears, before I could believe what I saw or heard"
commented the die-hard Black Hawk.51 His response typified
the reaction of  [[Native]]  peoples throughout the  [[North]] west. Cer
tainly, a dramatic and permanent shift in  [[British]]   [[Indian]]  policy
was unfolding. Indeed, the old glorious days of military "pomp
and ceremony" were irretrievably lost. In a few years new strat
egy would evolve to civilize and Christianize the  [[Native]]  peoples
residing in Canada, by "collecting them in villages (reserves),"
and inducing them to cultivate the land. As well, education and
religious instruction would be provided for the  [[Indian]]   [[child]] ren,
along with general medical expenses.52 Thus was born in
Canada the paternal reserve system, and the once proud and
defiant warriors were reduced to " War ds" of the state? from
" War riors to  War ds." For the  [[Native]]  peoples, hoes, seeds, and
bibles had replaced shot, powder, and muskets.
Throughout the long period of  [[British]] - [[Indian]]  military al
liances, the  [[Native]]  peoples had been caught in the grip of two
forces, an  [[empire]]  and a frontier, neither of which was particu
larly distinguished for mercy, and both of which were eventu
ally destined to resolve their differences by other methods than
costly  [[Indian]]   [[wars]] . Repeatedly during these critical years for
the tribes inhabiting the Great Lakes region, the warriors at

tached themselves to the  [[British]]  in each fight against the
 [[American]] s, as the  [[Native]]  peoples tried to salvage some remnants
of their traditional lands and cultural values, as the original
people. In the  War  of  [[1812]] , the warriors lashed out in one final
desperate defense of the old order. But, from the beginning of
contact,  [[Native]]  peoples in America and Canada could only delay
or retard, but not stem, the tide of these technologically dominant
and ever intruding newcomers. The  [[Indian]]  struggle was made
even more difficult by rampant tribal factionalism which (then as
now) broke the spirit of  [[Indian]]  unity and harmony; and made the
pretense of the existence of an  [[Indian]]  state or homeland, the
merest of fictions. A final  [[death]] blow for  [[Indian]]  interests was that
in the grand theater of international diplomacy,  [[Native]]  peoples
were considered expendable. By the end of the  War  of  [[1812]] , His
Majesty's  [[Indian]]  Allies were no longer needed nor desired by the
 [[British]]  in Canada. Nonetheless,  [[Native]]  peoples retained an
affection and loyalty to the  [[British]]   [[Crown]] . This continued
attachment stemmed in part from periodic bouts of  [[British]]  fairness
and justice toward them, as best evidenced by the Royal
Proclamation of  [[1763]]  in which the crown established a formal
procedure for purchasing the  [[Indian]]  interest in their traditional
lands; and to the fact that the warriors and  [[British]]  soldiers had
fought side by side over many years, as friends and comrades-in
arms. Yet, during a lengthy summer council in  [[1818]] , a sage old
chief rose and addressed the assembled. He knew full well that
all was lost for his generation, and concluded the speech to  [[British]]
 [[Crown]]  officials with a simple truth:
You are very kind when you want us to fight for you but
when that Service is performed, "the Store door be shut against
us."53
His observation reflected the "End of an Era."54
