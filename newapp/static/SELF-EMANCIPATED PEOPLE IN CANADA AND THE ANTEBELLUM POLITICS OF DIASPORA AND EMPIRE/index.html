Early in [[1839]] a group of “coloured inhabitants” in Upper Canada gathered to
draft a petition to the home [[government]] in London.^1 The memorial requested that
the [[British]] [[government]] protect self-emancipated people from cross-border pursuit
by [[United States]] authorities and ensure their social and intellectual advancement
in Canada; and it did so on the grounds that the refugees were “subjects of the
[[British]] Monarch.”^2 The letter was entrusted to Thomas Rolph, a white surgeon
from England, who then asked the governor general of [[British]] [[North]] America to
forward it to the colonial secretary in London. To the petitioners’ dismay, no reply
came. Suspecting that the governor general failed to act on Rolph’s request, they
turned to George Arthur, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, who delivered the
letter in [[May]] [[1839]].^3 After crossing the [[Atlantic]], the memorial circulated through
the metropolitan administrative sphere, leaving the colonial secretary’s hands for
the legal advisors to the [[Crown]].
During the late [[1830]]s and early [[1840]]s, seeking to enjoy the full benefits of
[[British]] freedom, formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[American]]s from the [[United States]]
developed communications linking Canada and the metropole and sought to incor-
porate themselves into the [[empire]] through those networks. Expressions of [[British]]
identity by black runaways are not particularly novel stories in the field of [[Africa]]n
[[American]] [[history]]; affiliation with [[Britain]] and its freedom is known to have been
an appealing and strategic choice for escaping U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s not only
for its symbolic power as the antithesis to U.S. [[slavery]], but also for what histori-
an Van Gosse called [[Britain]]’s extensive presence as “an imperial totality.”^4
Contextualizing U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s’ recourse to the [[Crown]] within [[Britain]]’s
increasing assumption of abolitionist moral superiority to regain its imperial in[[flu]]-
ence after [[1783]], Gosse described how the [[empire]]’s new post-Revolution agenda
provided [[Africa]]n [[American]]s in and outside the [[United States]] with a transatlantic
apparatus within which to fight [[slavery]] through the [[empire]]’s economic, military,

cultural, and diplomatic channels. Canada was the most prominent “site for con-
crete solidarity” where metropolitan and [[Canadian]] abolitionists successfully lob-
bied administrators on behalf of cross-border runaways to prevent fugitive extra-
ditions to the [[United States]].^5
What has been absent from this narrative of [[British]]–[[Africa]]n [[American]] [[alliance]]
is that [[Britain]]’s moral and political imperative toward the self-emancipated did not
become a matter of course. During the late [[1830]]s and early [[1840]]s, black refugees
themselves had to actively solicit the metropole’s support by fashioning themselves
as [[British]] emancipated subjects deserving of the [[empire]]’s protection and tutelage.
Setting foot on [[British]] territory did not automatically lead to a recognition of
[[British]] subjecthood; [[Africa]]n [[American]]s who settled in Canada wrote letters, sub-
mitted petitions, and held public meetings to appeal to metropolitan whites’ self-
image as benevolent emancipators. With their undeterred efforts, formerly enslaved
U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s convinced [[British]] abolitionists to treat the protection and
advancement of their freedom as part of the imperial agenda, and to work for the
successful circumvention of a bilateral extradition law with the [[United States]].
In foregrounding cross-border runaways’ reconstitution of self in their new
environment in [[British]] [[North]] America, I draw on work that highlights protean and
contextual identity performances among mobile individuals in the [[Africa]]n
Diaspora. Moving away from the traditional model that places diasporic subjects
on a linear progression toward identity formation, these studies pay attention to
shifting identifications articulated by those who traveled itinerantly over the
course of their lifetimes and to their strategic self-fashioning within the cultural
milieu of their immediate location.^6 Focus on the flexibility of identification
adapted to “constantly shifting sets of sociopolitical demands” holds a particular
resonance in the examination of formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[American]]s who recog-
nized the need to secure freedom and make progress within the social and politi-
cal bounds of the [[British]] Empire.^7
Their pursuit of imperial membership, I further argue, took place along racial
lines, that is, through black diasporic affiliation. Self-emancipated [[Africa]]n
[[American]]s advanced their integration by identifying with [[West]] [[Indian]] freedpeo-
ple—the legitimate and authentic beneficiaries of [[British]] emancipation. While
metropolitan abolitionists sometimes lumped them with [[East]] [[Indian]]s under the
category of [[British]] emancipated “blacks,” the refugees in Canada primarily equat-
ed themselves with their fellow “[[British]] Negroes” in the [[West]] Indies and contin-
ued to do so in the [[1850]]s, prompting participation of a black [[Jamaica]]n in this inter-
colonial racial identification. In this sense, their diasporic identity formations
reveal the potency of what historian Michael A. Gomez calls “a single status, a
lone condition, that of blackness, of descent of [[Africa]]” as well as the powerful
symbolic value of [[West]] [[Indian]]s in [[British]] freedom discourse.^8

Self-Emancipated People in Canada and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire 221
While articulating a sense of black collective advancement in the [[empire]], such
diasporic identifications took shape within constricted institutional and discursive
spheres delineated by inequitable racial structures of the post-emancipation [[empire]].
The limitations and promises of [[British]] identity in “an [[empire]] founded on race”
have been central themes in historical scholarship on “the black experience of
Empire.”^9 Putting their diasporic politics in this light, this essay shows how propo-
nents of [[British]] black identity had to navigate the straits of labor and cultural sys-
tems of emancipation that were racially exploitative and denigrating. Because of
their reliance on and genuine belief in [[Britain]]’s abolitionist authority, these [[Africa]]n-
descended people were compelled to constitute their [[British]] identities within the
ideologies and institutions of the burgeoning regime of freedom, but never fully
conformed to its hierarchical structures of racial governance. “[[British]] Negroes”
thus negotiated their place in the [[empire]] as they walked a delicate line between
ambivalently reinforcing and subtly subverting its racial inequities.
For cross-border runaways, black imperial identity was a double-edged sword:
it connected them to [[Britain]]’s anti-[[slavery]] movement, but also to its asymmetrical
orders of freedom. Within this narrow field of self-constitution and identity perform-
ance, U.S.-origin refugees made the most of what was available to them as they real-
ized the disturbing flexibility of the border between [[American]] [[slavery]] and [[British]]
freedom. Seeking protection and assistance from the metropole, they wrote and
spoke as [[British]] subjects. What follows is an exploration of an [[Africa]]n [[American]]
politics that emerged within a nexus of [[British]] [[empire]] and [[Africa]]n Diaspora. Above
all, it is a testament to self-emancipated people’s unflinching pursuit of freedom.
ENTERING THE EMPIRE
In the eyes of U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]] refugees, Canada was far from a land of
complete freedom. The fragility of their free status was instituted by the Upper
[[Canadian]] legislature in [[February]] [[1833]] with an act that provided for the extradition
of “Fugitive Offenders from Foreign Countries,” under which individuals charged
with “Murder, Forgery, Larceny, or other crime” could be returned to their origi-
nal places of the alleged crime.^10 The law stipulated that the governor and the
executive council could decide whether to surrender the charged person. While the
fugitives might well have counted on the provincial authorities for compassion,
historian Jason Silverman notes that the act “obviously threatened the freedom of
all runaway [[slaves]] from the [[United States]]: first, because many [[slaves]] indeed com-
mitted such crimes in the process of escaping; second, because slave owners might
bring false charges in order to regain their [[property]].”^11
The petitioners in the opening example denounced extradition as a breach of
imperial [[sovereignty]], whereby “Her subjects” have “but too often been inveigled

and forced back into all the horrors of [[slavery]]” by “their former owners whose
cupidity and thirst for power...will not consent to give up their supposed right
over them, even though living under the protection of the [[British]] flag.”^12 The
memorial recounted an arrest of an escaped individual from authorities in
Kentucky who hunted him down to Upper Canada on charges of stealing a horse.
The extradition was aborted only because “a body of his coloured brethren who
like himself had escaped from the galling yoke of [[slavery]]” set the wanted man
free.^13 These fugitives from the U.S. slave regime, “who were determined to per-
ish to a man, rather than behold their brother surrendered up to the merciless feroc-
ity of his former master,” lost two of their compatriots during the rescue. With the
memory of the arrest and [[death]]s fresh in their minds, the petitioners ardently dis-
played loyalty to the [[British]] Empire so as to “be regarded and considered as nat-
uralized subjects of Great [[Britain]], to be alike protected by as well as rendered
amenable to [[British]] law.”^14
In addition to [[government]]al protection against extraditions, the memorial
requested the promotion of schools for [[Africa]]n [[American]] [[[[child]]ren]] on the grounds
that [[government]]al funds had been expended on the education of freedpeople in the
[[British]] [[West]] Indies. Casting their appeal in a nationalist light and linking it to their
willingness to “become good Christians, good subjects, and enlightened members
of the community,” the petitioners cited “the liberal and munificent donations
bestowed on their brethren in the [[West]] Indies by Her Majesty’s Government, for
the purpose of promoting their moral and religious instruction.”^15 By identifying
themselves as the [[Canadian]] counterpart of the [[West]] [[Indian]] emancipated people,
the memorialists justified their hope that “some aid [would] be extended to the
colored population of Upper Canada.”^16
The “donations” given to the [[West]] [[Indian]]s included the “Negro Education
Grant,” a subsidy from the imperial [[government]] initiated in [[1835]] for the educa-
tion of the formerly enslaved population.^17 This policy emerged against the back-
drop of the home [[government]]’s broader endeavor to institute a “structure of labor
control” designed to ensure the freedpeople’s productivity under the new princi-
ples of wage labor.^18 Embedded in the tenets of bourgeois political economy, this
state-initiated effort went beyond economic concerns and aimed at changing the
overall structure of the former slave colonies into “the right sort of society and cul-
ture.”^19 In that model, according to Thomas C. Holt, freedpeople would act in pur-
suit of “personal accumulation and [in] deference to proper authority” within a
gendered social order divided into the masculinized terrain of wage work and the
feminized domestic realm of reproduction and consumption.^20 The educational
effort was thus a bid to transform emancipated [[West]] [[Indian]]s into colonial free
laborers with the proper intellect, piety, industry, and material desires deemed nec-
essary to ensure stable agricultural production.

Self-Emancipated People in Canada and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire 223
This new principle of free labor, however, contradicted both the reality of the
[[plantation]]s and freedpeople’s own economic and social objectives. Emancipated
people in [[Jamaica]], for example, sought to manage their labor at their own discre-
tion as they combined [[plantation]] work and small-scale cultivation for self-suffi-
ciency and local market exchange.^21 Also, if some women withdrew from estate
labor, it was not because they complied with bourgeois gender ideology; rather,
they sought protection from grueling physical drudgery and assurance of the sur-
vival of their domestic and communal life independent of the planter class.^22 In
accordance with these alter[[native]] ethics, freedmen and women carved out a social,
familial, and economic life that conflicted with the maximization of profits from
wage-based estate production.
Likewise, the petitioners in Canada showed no sign of perceiving themselves
as wage laborers as they appropriated the powerful national banner of post-eman-
cipation “reform.” Their aspirations for intellectual and moral improvement were
divorced from the capitalist principle of labor efficiency. Their vision was to repli-
cate in Canada institutions of emancipation devoid of liberal economic functions
and to use them to create a self-sustaining population of self-emancipated people.
The imperial [[government]]’s response to the [[1839]] petition boded poorly for the
security of the freedom of fugitives from U.S. [[slavery]]. The return dispatch from
London mentioned the [[Queen]]’s “satisfaction at the sentiments of ardent attach-
ment to Her Person and Government” expressed by the petitioners, but exhibited
the [[British]] [[government]]’s passive stance on fugitive slave extradition. It cited a
report of the Law Officers of the [[Crown]] that “under the existing law of Upper
Canada no difference was made between colored and white men—between fugi-
tive [[slaves]] and other individuals arriving in Canada from the [[United States]]—and
that it would not be lawful to deliver up a fugitive slave in any circumstances in
which a white man would not also be delivered up.”^23 In sum, the report conclud-
ed that cross-border runaways would not be subjected to a higher chance of extra-
dition than would white individuals, but that neither would there be any special
legal shield for the former. The dispatch stated that this principle, if implemented
properly, was “amply sufficient for the protection of the petitioners” and that
beyond the equal application of the law “Her Majesty has no power to advance,
nor to grant to one class of Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by
others.”^24 With regard to the promotion of educational facilities, the secretary
directed the petitioners to appeal to the provincial legislature.
It should be noted, however, that while the home [[government]] promised no
special protection or educational opportunities for U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s fleeing
to Canada, the correspondence suggests a certain degree of success in introducing
them into official imperial discourse as one group of black [[British]] subjects. To
begin, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada found the petition by “Her

224 The Journal of [[Africa]]n [[American]] History
Majesty’s coloured subjects,” as he called them, legitimate enough to place it in
the imperial administrative network.^25 The officials in London then defined the
home [[government]]’s approach toward the protection of the refugees’ freedom.
While the decision was not to implement any concrete measures, the reason for the
inaction—that “Her Majesty has no power to advance, nor to grant to one class of
Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by others”—implies recogni-
tion that these formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s were indeed “Her
Subjects.”^26
This limited victory did not immediately change the grim reality facing self-
emancipated people. The officials viewed fugitive slave extradition as a legitimate
bilateral system, not an aggression on state [[sovereignty]] that the memorial made it
out to be. To black refugees from the [[United States]] the absence of [[slavery]] in
Canada was a [[British]] condition that should be maintained within its colonial
boundaries. Thus, any exertion of U.S. jurisdiction in Canada signified an infiltra-
tion of the border between [[British]] freedom and [[American]] [[slavery]]. This rigid sep-
aration of free and unfree spaces did not win the hearts of [[British]] officials, who
were well aware of the role of diplomatic relations in shaping the operation of the
U.S.-[[Canadian]] border.
Outside official imperial networks, inter-colonial diasporic identities flour-
ished in various cultural venues in Canada. An [[1839]] prospectus for the periodical
The [[British]] [[American]] Journal of Liberty was a case in point. In solidifying the
identity of the black newcomers as “Her Majesty’s Coloured subjects in Upper
Canada,” the editors Peter Gallego and E. L. De St. Remy looked southward to
another group of emancipated people for political and racial association. The two
men promised to report on “the progress of our fellow subjects in the [[West]] Indies,”
a promise reflective of their diasporic identity as well as their referential use of the
[[West]] [[Indian]]s to gauge the prospects and possibilities available for the emancipat-
ed [[Africa]]n-descended people in the [[empire]].^27
The practice of inter-colonial identification very likely developed out of the
annual imperial emancipation celebrations that originated in the [[West]] Indies to pub-
licly display and nurture loyal sentiments around the [[British]] abolition of [[slavery]].^28
The patriotic function of these rituals differed from the much-discussed politics of
[[West]] [[Indian]] emancipation in the [[United States]] that championed the event as a rally-
ing point to oppose U.S. [[slavery]].^29 Rather in Canada, [[British]] emancipation became
a symbol around which self-emancipated people forged commonality with those in
the [[West]] Indies as subject beneficiaries of that policy. An [[1841]] imperial emancipa-
tion celebration illustrates this point. In Chatham, Canada, one of the Detroit River
border towns, formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s explicitly cast themselves
as one group of emancipated subjects who were enjoying the blessings of the [[1833]]
act, and they “celebrated the important event of their emancipation throughout the

[[British]] dominions—in a manner, too, that showed the value and consequence
attached by them to the boon of freedom.”^30 The celebrations included a procession
that “paraded through the streets for some time, to the number of about one hundred”
and a festive dinner in the evening, after which “they figured away in the merry
dance until a late hour.”^31 Similarly, three years later, at a meeting of black refugees
in the same town, they expressed their gratitude for “what [[[Britain]] had] done and
thanked “her noble statesmen” for “break[ing] the fetters of the Slave.”^32 Here the
“Slave” referred to the formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[American]]s in Canada (many
refugees from the [[United States]]) and “our brethren in the [[West]] Indies,” both
“Coloured Subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty [[Queen]] Victoria.”^33
These sentiments and performances of [[British]] identity circulated in print
through newspapers and eventually reached London. In [[1840]] their voice also
entered metropolitan abolitionist circles through the medium of the same Thomas
Rolph. This time, Rolph used as his platform the [[World]] Anti-Slavery Convention
of [[June]] [[1840]], convened by the [[British]] and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS),
a fledgling London-based abolitionist organization. Self-emancipated people’s
call for help resonated well at the convention conceived to present new directions
for [[British]] abolitionism in the post-emancipation era.
At this international forum, U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]] runaways constituted the
convention’s agenda under the category “Condition of the Emancipated,” which
also included important information on [[Africa]]n-descended peoples in Haiti, [[South]]
America, and the [[British]] [[West]] Indies.^34 As the primary messenger on behalf of
black refugees, Rolph not only presented to the metropolitan audience their capac-
ities to be ideal colonial subjects, but also conveyed their own ideas of [[British]]
freedom and identity.^35
The highlight of Rolph’s presentation was an excerpt of a meeting of
“Coloured People at Ancaster,” Canada, convened earlier to draft appeals to the
imperial and provincial [[government]]s, with the intent of sharing them at the [[World]]
Anti-Slavery Convention.^36 In a tone similar to the [[1839]] memorial, the partici-
pants announced that they “emigrate to this and other [[British]] colonies to enjoy that
[[liberty]] and protection which alone is afforded by the [[British]] Government and law”
and asked the provincial legislature and the [[Crown]] to enact a law providing for a
trial by jury for an alleged fugitive before he or she “shall be handed over to the
authorities of the [[United States]].”^37 After the address, Rolph and five abolitionists
from different cities in the [[British]] Isles founded a committee, which recommend-
ed that the convention press the issue with colonial administrators in Canada.^38
With the increasing outcry from Canada, metropolitan abolitionists began to
discuss self-emancipated people along with other groups of the [[British]] emancipat-
ed. There is evidence that black refugees in Canada were associated with recently
emancipated black [[West]] [[Indian]]s within the context of a distinctly imperial govern-

ing structure: the itinerant appointment of administrative officers to different colo-
nial posts. In [[1843]] Thomas Clarkson, the driving force behind [[British]] emancipa-
tion, appealed to Charles Metcalf, the governor of Canada who once governed
[[Jamaica]] as well, for the protection of [[Africa]]n [[American]] escapees in his province.
In his communication Clarkson painted a picture of runaways becoming “produc-
tive of great good to the mother country ” as they were “a quiet and orderly peo-
ple” who gave “no trouble to the [[government]].”^39 What is notable is that Clarkson
founded the plausibility of this blueprint upon “the spirit of independency , the
industry and the prodigious execution of the free [N]egro in [[Jamaica]],” which,
Clarkson claimed, “No one knows better than Your Excellency.”^40
In expressing his confidence that Metcalf would “protect the unhappy fugi-
tives against the claims of an enraged master,” Clarkson posited a paternalistic
image of the governor as a colonial administrator who routinely presided over dif-
ferent groups of freedpeople living throughout the [[empire]]. “When he left his
Government at [[Jamaica]],” Clarkson declared, “ten thousand emancipated [[slaves]]
followed him to the water’s edge with tears, to take their leave of him. He is the
same benevolent man in Canada, as he was in [[Jamaica]] as favors the poor [N]egro
is concerned.”^41 The cultural figure of the benevolent [[British]] governor with inter-
colonial mobility went hand in hand with a vision of separately located emanci-
pated peoples contributing to imperial prosperity under an itinerant administrator.
The system of rotating colonial governorship thus helped link distant emancipat-
ed subjects within the white imperial imagination.
More importantly, [[Africa]]n ancestry was not the exclusive register of common-
ality for metropolitan abolitionists. They went beyond Canada and the [[West]] Indies
in their mapping of the [[British]] emancipated to include [[East]] [[Indian]]s in Malabar
who had been freed by the [[East]] India Company in [[1836]]. In [[1846]], three years after
Clarkson’s correspondence with Metcalf, abolitionist William T. Blair made the
connection between the self-emancipated people in Canada and freedpeople in the
coastal region of southwestern India.^42 The abolitionist from Bath asked the
BFASS leadership to publish his letter, which stressed the [[British]] [[government]]’s
duty of “elevating the [[slaves]] to a real state of freedom” and the need for quick
implementation of [[government]]al systems of education.^43 The areas of concern
were two [[British]] colonial spaces—Canada and [[East]] India:
The [[government]] ought to provide funds for schools, and authorize their offices in the provinces
of Canada and Malabar to appropriate [[government]] lands and to afford every facility to their
instruction and amelioration. At present nothing is done but by sufferance. The [[government]]
do[es] not actually impede, but the next thing to it,—what is required is a positive order to this
[[government]] to forward the education, and the amelioration of the classes in every possible way,
and to countenance and assist every population for the freedom secured to them by [[British]] law.^44

Self-Emancipated People in Canada and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire 227
In Blair’s mind, both [[East]] [[Indian]]s and formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s
in Canada were [[British]] emancipated subjects and their successful transition to
freedom represented the triumph of the imperial move to abolition.
The coupling of the two groups made sense given the [[history]] of racial group-
ing in the metropole. By the late 18th century, [[East]] [[Indian]] seamen, or lascars,
became a visible presence in English seaport cities. Called “Asiatic blacks” by
metropolitan whites, [[South]] Asians constituted the “blacks,” along with people of
Sub-Saharan [[Africa]]n descent. In [[1786]] they became an object of a private (and later
[[government]]-funded) relief effort aimed at the “black poor” in London, a designa-
tion covering both [[East]] [[Indian]] and [[West]] [[Indian]] “blacks” in London, often identi-
fied by their impoverished condition and need of [[British]] benevolence. Criminal
records and Parliamentary Papers reveal that this situation for the black poor con-
tinued well into the 19th century.^45 Within this cultural milieu William Blair artic-
ulated the association between emancipated “blacks” in Malabar and Canada and
the need to establish imperial policy appropriate for both.
Despite abolitionists’ growing recognition of formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n
[[American]]s in Canada as emancipated [[British]] subjects, the imperial [[government]]
allowed an extradition back to the [[United States]] in [[1842]], which was in some ways
not surprising given the reaction to the [[1839]] petition from Canada. The protago-
nist, Nelson Hackett, was a runaway and fugitive from Arkansas who succeeded
in crossing the Detroit River sometime in [[September]] [[1841]]. He was tracked down
and arrested by two slave catchers from Arkansas and charged with stealing a
beaver overcoat, a [[gold]] watch, a saddle, and a horse from his master and others.
The [[Washington]] County Grand Jury of Arkansas had indicted Hackett for grand
larceny, and Arkansas [[Governor]] Archibald Yell requested that the [[Canadian]] gov-
ernment surrender Hackett as a “criminal” fugitive. In [[January]] [[1842]], the governor
general of Canada, Charles Bagot, ordered that Hackett be turned over to
Arkansas. In response, BFASS secretary John Scoble labored to find ways to
block the extradition, contacting diverse parties in the [[United States]] and England,
including [[American]] Lewis Tappen and the [[British]] Colonial Office. Unfortunately,
the group’s efforts did not bear fruit and the extradition took place later in [[1842]].^46
On the heels of Nelson Hackett’s surrender to U.S. slave catchers came a new
challenge to the freedom of [[Africa]]n [[American]]s escaping to Canada: the Webster-
Ashburton [[Treaty]], a new U.S.-[[British]] bilateral agreement under negotiation in</p>
<p>The specific issue was Article 10 of the [[treaty]] that provided for the mutual
      surrender of fugitive “criminals” and thus placed in jeopardy the freedom of black
      refugees living in Canada. Fearing that the article would be applied specifically to
      fugitive “[[slaves]]” in Canada and other [[British]] territories, the BFASS campaigned
      for their exemption, petitioning the Parliament; the Foreign Secretary, George</p>

228 The Journal of [[Africa]]n [[American]] History
Hamilton-Gordon, the Fourth Earl of Aberdeen; and Alexander Baring, the First
Baron of Ashburton, who authored the [[treaty]].^47
The BFASS’s campaign could not have occurred without the untiring appeals
from escaped [[Africa]]n [[American]]s themselves who managed to persuade the aboli-
tionists that the refugees were entitled to freedom as [[British]] subjects. Such recog-
nition also in[[flu]]enced the way the self-emancipated were constructed in the
BFASS’s annual reports. The [[June]] [[1843]] report covered the period of the Hackett
extradition and the Webster-Ashburton [[Treaty]]; the issue of “fugitive [[slaves]]”
appeared in the “Home Operations” section pertaining to [[slavery]] and post-eman-
cipation conditions in the [[British]] colonies, not in “Foreign Operations,” which
covered individuals the society considered “non-[[British]] subjects” such as the
enslaved populations in the [[United States]] and Brazil.^48 “Fugitive [[Slaves]] within the
[[British]] Dominions” was also added to the group’s agenda, and was listed with
concerns about post-emancipation conditions in the [[British]] [[West]] Indies, antislav-
ery campaigns in [[British]] [[East]] India and [[British]] settlements in [[South]]east Asia, and
enslaved “[[British]] subjects” in the [[Spanish]] and [[Dutch]] colonies.^48 Further illustrat-
ing the society’s interests, the “Home Operations” section of the BFASS’s fourth
annual report concluded with an exhortation that the extradition issue required
“the best attention of [[British]] abolitionists.”^50
The [[British]] [[government]] soon backed away from the enforcement of Webster-
Ashburton’s Article 10 on fugitive slave extraditions. This was triggered in [[1844]]
when seven enslaved workers from Florida escaped to Nassau in the Bahamas;
they faced a risk of extradition on charges of murder in the [[United States]]. The
[[British]] [[government]], having adopted a policy of preventing extraditions on the
basis of procedural technicalities, successfully argued that the documents submit-
ted were insufficient to prove the fugitives’ crime.^51 [[Britain]]’s stance was further
consolidated when Foreign Secretary Aberdeen refused to concede to the U.S.
[[government]]’s request for the invocation of Article 10 in fugitive slave cases.^52 By
[[1845]] [[British]] abolitionists concluded [[British]] soil to be safe from the voracious
force of the U.S. authorities. With their persistent assertions of free [[British]] identi-
ty, self-emancipated people successfully elicited support and protection from met-
ropolitan abolitionists and [[British]] officials.
ARTICULATIONS OF “THE BRITISH NEGRO”
Acutely aware that the [[West]] [[Indian]] freedpeople constituted a primary symbol
of [[British]] emancipation and progress, formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s
living in Canada continued to forge a common identity with their Caribbean coun-
terparts. After the passage of the [[1850]] Fugitive Slave Law, which led to a substan-
tial increase in the number of cross-border black migrants, identification with

Afro-[[West]] [[Indian]]s proliferated in [[Africa]]n [[American]] public discourse inside and
outside Canada. Samuel Ring[[gold]] Ward, a seasoned [[Africa]]n [[American]] abolition-
ist from [[New York]], spearheaded this identification. In many ways Ward was not a
typical runaway, for he had escaped from [[slavery]] at the age of three with his par-
ents and had lived as a free person in [[New York]] State until he fled to Canada.
Although with no personal memory of enslavement, he saw himself as a fugitive
from U.S. [[slavery]], but for a slightly different reason. In [[October]] [[1851]] Ward and
other members of the Syracuse Vigilance Committee rescued runaway Jerry
McHenry from federal authorities and helped him escape to [[[[King]]ston]], Canada.
Ward and Jermain Loguen, the vice chairman of the vigilance committee, soon
afterward left for Canada themselves, fearing arrest for obstructing the Fugitive
Slave Law.^53 Equating his escape from arrest with escaping workers’ flight from
re-enslavement, both fleeing the pro-[[slavery]] regime, Ward declared to fugitive
Henry Bibb, “I am, like yourself, a refugee.”^54
Samuel R. Ward
Samuel Ward constructed an idealized black [[West]] [[Indian]] figure by articulat-
ing visions of freedom and belonging for his oppressed people. He built a com-
mon black [[British]] identity upon both differences and commonalities between “this
large and growing class of Her Majesty’s subjects” in Canada and “the descen-

dants of [[Africa]], in other parts of the [[empire]].”^55 Noting that “the blacks in the [[West]]
Indies, now among the wealthiest, most learned and most in[[flu]]ential of Her
Majesty’s colonial subjects, were, a century ago, poor and as illiterate as we are
now [due to what] Slavery did to them.” Ward proclaimed to his fellow refugees,
“What they are, we must be. We must become such by our own efforts, as did they.
We cannot begin too soon.”^56 In explaining his decision to found a black newspa-
per in Canada, Ward defined it as an advocate for the social, economic, and polit-
ical advancement of formerly enslaved people and to raise them “to the proud
position of the blacks in other parts of our glorious [[empire]].”^57 In his blueprint for
the future within the [[British]] Empire, the [[West]] [[Indian]] freedpeople served as a
model of progress for recent arrivals from the [[United States]].
Ward also intended this inter-colonial affiliation to help him solicit assistance
from the metropolitan public since he was fully aware of the utility of the [[West]]
[[Indian]] freedpeople—the most prominent symbol of [[British]] benevolent paternal-
ism—in appealing to white Britons’ pride as benefactors of emancipation and
progress. During his tour around the [[British]] Isles to raise funds on former [[slaves]]’
behalf, Ward categorized emancipated black [[West]] [[Indian]]s and [[Canadian]]s, and
self-emancipated U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s in Canada as the “[[British]] Negro,”
ascribing to them devotion to imperial prosperity and to Christian faith.^58
In his speeches throughout the [[United [[King]]dom]], Ward emphasized the contri-
bution of [[Africa]]n-descended subjects to the af[[flu]]ence of the [[empire]], categorizing
black [[West]] [[Indian]]s and [[Canadian]]s as one distinct group of colonial laborers.
“Indeed to the [[British]] people,” he claimed at a public meeting, “was committed a
very large proportion of the [N]egro race.”^59 “How many of that race,” he contin-
ued, “were labouring for the welfare of Great [[Britain]] in the [[West]] Indies and in
Canada? What did the Almighty mean by this, but that sympathies should be
awakened in the minds of the [[British]] people, and be practically realised, for the
future welfare of the oppressed and the down-trodden.”^60
Indeed, Ward’s invocation of the two groups’ status as black colonial laborers
was both reinforcing and transgressing what historian Seymour Drescher calls the
“racialization of labor and migration in the [[British]] political imagination” in the
mid-19th century.^61 On the one hand, his appeal grounded black [[West]] [[Indian]]s’
imperial belonging in their tropical labor, which ambivalently locked them in a
racially exploitative relationship to the [[empire]]. On the other hand, self-emancipat-
ed people unsettled the racial boundaries of [[Canadian]] settler [[colonialism]], which
by this time was manifested in anti-black [[protest]]s by white colonists who assert-
ed exclusive ownership of [[Canadian]] land by “thousands of our countrymen of our
own color.”^62 In light of the racially unsettling nature of black presence in a white
settler [[colony]], Ward’s definition of black belonging can be seen as a radical act in
its disruption of the racialized structures of the free labor [[empire]].

COLONIAL M[[ISS]]IONARIES AND RA[[CIA]]L STRUCTURES
In addition to labor, Ward invoked religious piety—a characteristic believed
to reside in an ideal colonial subject and thus cited by diverse “black” groups with-
in the [[empire]] as a marker of their [[British]] identity.^63 In [[1854]] Ward proudly
announced that “the preaching of the gospel was attended with great success
amongst them [the self-emancipated in Canada], and that they were as loyal as any
of her Majesty’s subjects. The same might be said of the [[West]] Indies.”^64 Framing
the two peoples as equally devout populations despite their past enslavement,
Ward lent legitimacy to his claim for metropolitan aid.
Such inter-colonial diasporic identification was further fostered by black [[West]]
[[Indian]]s within a racially structured colonial missionary apparatus. Rev. Robert
Gordon, a preacher from [[Jamaica]], forged a common black identity informed by
the past diasporic experience of enslavement and the current freedom in the
[[British]] Empire as he worked for a mission to the self-emancipated [[Africa]]n
[[American]]s in Canada. The mission, operated by the Colonial Church and School
Society, was first proposed at a committee meeting in [[April]] [[1853]] and became
known as the “Fugitive Slave Mission” by [[1856]]. The religious venture had two
goals: abolition of U.S. [[slavery]] and the social uplift of black colonial subjects.^65
The Fugitive Slave Mission was devised with the hopes that “the spectacle of a
large body of the [N]egro race, elevated in social and religious condition, and
walking like Christian men in the light of the Gospel” would help effect abolition-
ist campaigns in the [[United States]].^66 At the same time, the mission was considered
an endeavor to advance the religious training of fellow [[British]] subjects. “Our
attention,” the society declared, “has been called to the miserable condition of the
fugitive colored population in our own [[colony]] of Canada,” who “as our fellow
subjects, have a special claim on our regard.”^67
The Colonial Church and School Society, with many branches dominated by
women, offered an institutional and ideological frame—albeit a narrow one—for
developing a common racial identity among [[Africa]]n-descended colonial subjects
in the [[empire]]. In the annual report of the year [[1856]]–[[1857]], the period during which
its [[West]] [[Indian]] missions went into operation, religious instruction for self-eman-
cipated people in Canada and “the emancipated [N]egroes of the [[West]] Indies”
were identified as two branches of one larger project of “civilizing the [[Africa]]n
race” within the [[empire]].^68 The report set the two groups side by side, pleading for
“the sympathies of [[British]] Christians of the beautiful and now impoverished [[West]]
India islands, where such openings are being made for the labors of the Society;
of the fugitive [[slaves]] also, who are annually seeking the protection of the [[British]]
[[empire]] on [[Canadian]] soil.”^69
The society’s mission in [[Jamaica]] inspired Gordon to develop an interest in its

Fugitive Slave Mission. He acquainted himself with the society’s officers sta-
tioned in [[Jamaica]], who may well have informed Rev. Gordon that there was anoth-
er emancipated population under the instruction of the society. Also, missionary
publications very likely reached [[Jamaica]] and piqued Gordon’s interest in the proj-
ect, generating in him a sense of common destiny with his fellow subjects in
Canada. Eventually, Gordon applied for a position in the Fugitive Slave Mission
and, after successfully passing an interview with the society, he was recommend-
ed to the [[Bishop]] of [[Huron]] as a catechist.^70
“Mission to the Fugitive [[Slaves]] in Canada” ([[1856]]).
Rev. Gordon’s identification with self-emancipated people in Canada devel-
oped within the unequal race relations of the colonial missions. The appointment of
Gordon to Canada was in accordance with metropolitan whites’ understanding that
the Fugitive Slave Mission required expertise in “the characteristics of the [[Africa]]n
race” that mostly took on negative connotations, evident in the officers’ statement
that former [[slaves]] were in “the lowest state of ignorance of religion, and even of
secular knowledge.”^71 Indeed, the society had already appointed white missionar-
ies with experience in the [[West]] Indies and hired women of [[Africa]]n descent. Those
appointed, Rev. M. M. Dillon and a lay missionary named Ballantine, had worked
in Dominica, the former as rector and the latter as teacher for the Mico Charity in
charge of instructing “the colored boys.”^72 At Dillon’s request, the positions of

infant school teachers were filled by “two young colored females named Titre,” sis-
ters who had accompanied Ballantine from Dominica and were then studying at the
Home and Colonial Institution, the society’s school for the training of missionaries
to be sent across the [[empire]].^73 Rev. Gordon’s work was set within this doubly hier-
archical structure of colonial missionary operations, where whites’ sense of
supremacy over emancipated populations underlined their evangelizing projects;
and where relocated black subjects worked in a subordinate position to white mis-
sionaries.
“Sh[o]wing the Principal Stations of the Free Colored Population,” circa [[1850]].
Gordon’s interstitial position was revealed in the remaining records that docu-
mented his racial identification as well as the inequitable colonial governance. On the
first day of [[August]] [[1859]], Rev. Gordon delivered a sermon to the “colored citizens of
London, Canada, and several other places” who gathered at St. Paul’s Cathedral on
the “the 21st Anniversary of the Emancipation of the black and colored [[slaves]] of the
[[British]] [[West]] Indies.”^74 Following the tradition of [[British]] emancipation celebrations in
Canada, Gordon urged his audience to celebrate the occasion as fellow beneficiaries
of freedom along with those in the [[West]] Indies, concluding that “it well becomes the
colored people to consider this day as a Festival; since enjoying here, as they can do
wherever the [[British]] Banner is unfurled, as indicative of territorial possession, the
blessed privilege of sitting unmolested under their own vine and fig tree, protected as
well as their white brethren by laws which are impartially administered.”^75

From his perspective as a missionary, the enjoyment of freedom under the
[[British]] flag meant the acceptance of educational and religious instruction at the
mission, through which his understanding of a common diasporic identity was
articulated. “I would specially address my colored brethren,” Rev. Gordon exhort-
ed, “on the necessity of their practically exhibiting their appreciation of, and grat-
itude for, the efforts which that most estimable Institution, the Colonial Church
and School Society, are making for their moral, social, and religious advancement,
through the male and female agents sent to them.”^76 Although expressing a unified
racial identity with his “colored brethren,” his attachment to the colonial mission-
ary hierarchy led Gordon to reiterate its racial tenets, patronizingly instructing
black [[Canadian]]s to appreciate white evangelists, who “benevolently hold out their
hands to you,” and to depend on them for moral education because black [[parents]]
were “generally...incapable of religiously instructing [their] [[[[child]]ren]].”^77
As passionate a worker as he was, less than four months after the sermon, the
society discharged Rev. Gordon from his position due to the “indiscretion” he
committed, namely collecting funds for a new church building without permission
from the white missionary officers in Canada and London.^78 Rev. Gordon left
Canada for the [[West]] Indies in late [[January]] [[1860]] and on the eve of his return, he
penned a letter to the committee in England “pray[ing] for the prosperity of the
Society.”^79
Censured for bypassing white authorities, Gordon’s departure illustrated the
asymmetrical power relations on which he hoped to forge a united [[British]] identi-
ty among [[Africa]]n diasporic populations. Since black colonial subjecthood was
embedded in the racial hierarchies of [[empire]], diasporic identities that emerged
within them consequently faced narrow and constrained realms of formation and
development. Not only regulated discursively by colonial racial paradigms,
Gordon’s aspirations for collective improvement were quickly shattered once he
overstepped the boundaries of colonial missionary rule.
CONCLUSION
The post-emancipation [[British]] Empire enabled diasporic mappings by dis-
persed freedpeople for political use. Metropolitan abolitionists formulated geogra-
phies of [[empire]] that located formerly enslaved people in Canada along with
“black” subjects in other regions, ranging from the [[West]] Indies to [[East]] India. More
importantly, self-emancipated people from the [[United States]] living in Canada
identified with emancipated [[West]] [[Indian]]s in articulating their “belonging” as
[[British]] colonial subjects. This conceptual connection suggests the significance of
[[Africa]]n diasporic identity for formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[American]]s’ forma-
tion of self. The powerful symbolism of [[West]] [[Indian]] emancipation in [[British]] polit-

ical discourse further enhanced its usefulness as a discursive tool.
Black refugees’ association with emancipated [[West]] [[Indian]]s should be contex-
tualized within the complex layers of political and diplomatic relations that shaped
the mid-19th-century [[Atlantic]] [[World]]. This era saw an increased divergence of state
policies regarding [[slavery]], which inspired many [[Africa]]n [[American]]s in bondage to
view enslavement as contingent upon the state or nation in which they resided,
resulting in flights to “free” territory, in this case Upper Canada. However, mov-
ing to a “free” space did not guarantee one’s protection from legal proceedings ini-
tiated from across the border to regain lost “[[property]].” Self-emancipated people’s
fashioning of a [[British]] identity was meant not only to express their appreciation of
freedom on [[British]] soil, but also to secure their tenuous freedom from the inter-
loping U.S. slave power. In this sense the fugitives’ [[British]] identity did not signal
a complete break from enslavement in the [[United States]], but instead reflected their
closeness to it, conditioned by a bilateral [[treaty]] system that inherently unsettled
the national border between freedom and [[slavery]].
In such precarious conditions of freedom, the presence of already emancipat-
ed [[Africa]]n-descended people evoked particular diasporic politics, leading to the
creation of the “[[British]] Negro.” This identity signified [[government]]-secured
freedom and social and political advancement as free subjects. Self-emancipated
people’s diasporic strategy represented an effort to exploit the [[British]] Empire’s
redefined relationship to [[slavery]] and its reframed self-image as a white ruler and
protector of “freed” darker peoples, a dynamic that was racially inequitable in its
own distinctive ways. Seeking to make the most of what [[British]] freedom could
offer, self-emancipated [[Africa]]n [[American]]s from the [[United States]] physically and
intellectually maneuvered their way through the new political and economic geog-
raphies of the [[Atlantic]] [[World]].

Upper Canada was a [[British]] [[colony]] that existed from [[1791]] to [[1841]] and included an expanse of land surrounded
by the Michigan-Canada border, Lakes [[Ontario]], [[Huron]], and Erie—an area most accessible to U.S. [[Africa]]n
[[American]]s fleeing from the Upper [[South]] and the border states. The province had the largest fugitive slave pop-
ulation in [[British]] [[North]] America. In this article, I interchange Upper Canada and Canada for convenience.
