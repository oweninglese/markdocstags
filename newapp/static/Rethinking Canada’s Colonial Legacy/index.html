(An)Other Canada is Possible
Rethinking Canada’s Colonial Legacy
Néstor Medina and Becca Whitla
Abstract in English
The authors interrogate the geo-political power negotiations that
contributed to the ideological construction of Canada as a nation. This
article focuses especially on the connection with the  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an
colonial projects in the Americas initiated over 500 years ago, along the lines
of Latin  [[American]]  decolonial thinkers. The myth of Canada as a benign,
welcoming, generous, peace-keeping, multicultural nation and society is
unsanitized and dismantled. Canada’s  [[history]]  is resituated in relation to
the ideological organization of the world according to racialized, classist,
and cultural Eurocentric colonial indicators, which have contributed to
the historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation, racialized
discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout the Americas.
Key words : Decolonizing, Canada, Multiculturalism, Decolonial Thinking,
Racism, Colonial Desire

Present global migration crises, the volatile international
environment of war and terrorism, growing tides of uninformed
islamophobia, and the retrenchment of nationalist attitudes in
the Global  [[North]]  signal a change in the seas in the ways peo-
ples from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds relate to
each other. Many in what is now Canada look to our neighbour
south of the border and celebrate that the  [[Canadian]]  social
context is not as politically or ethnoracially charged. Others
contrast the  [[history]]  of Jim Crow law and segregation in the
 [[U.S.A.]]  with the Multicultural Act , proudly and self-righteously
claiming Canada’s attempt to incorporate ethnoracial cultural
diversity as part of the nation’s identity and imaginary.
It is our argument, however, that Canada’s ability to build
a more inclusive society will depend on its capacity to accept
responsibility for the ways in which racism, xenophobia, and
ethnocultural intolerance have shaped the national imaginary.
We draw from the wisdom of decolonial scholars in the Global
 [[South]] ,^1 particularly from Latin America, in order to interrogate
how racialization continues to shape the way current social,
cultural, political, and religious structures privilege the Euro
Anglo sectors of  [[Canadian]]  society. Their work unmasks the
fact that the colonial imperial projects initiated by  [[West]] ern
 [[Europe]] ans some five hundred years ago are responsible for the
historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation,
racialized discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout
the Americas. Indigenous scholars in what is now Canada have
also confronted ideologies of  [[multiculturalism]] , for example,
because of Canada’s failure to recognize the long-standing
(^1) It is important to note that many decolonial scholars are Latin  [[American]] s
who reside and work in the  [[U.S.A.]]  but who emphasize that their place of
enunciation is Latin America. It is also important to note that decolonial
theoretical currents are part of a long-standing line of critical theoretical
articulations in Latin America which include critiques to notions of devel-
opmentalism, dependency theoretical frames, and  [[liberation]]  discourses.

 [[history]]  of  [[colonialism]]  which goes back five hundred years.
Their work has already made significant contributions to
exposing Canada’s racialized  [[history]]  of discrimination against
Indigenous communities. Our approach is to also highlight
how the  [[Europe]] an project of imperial expansion and colonial-
ism has had direct implications for many of the communities
that have made Canada their home since contact. Our inten-
tion here is to build on existing critical work by exa [[mining]]
this  [[history]]  through the lens of this larger colonial project. We
also acknowledge that Canada’s role as colonial power is com-
plicated by the dual character of its colonial status; both as
a colonial power, an extension of  [[Europe]] , and as a colonized
nation, an object of  [[Europe]] an and  [[U.S.A.]]  colonial desire.
At the outset, we argue that the complex and multiply
diverse ethnoracial and cultural contexts of Canada do not eas-
ily fit into the paradigms of postcolonial scholars, but are better
suited to decolonial frameworks. Let us consider why. Both
intellectual currents display orientations which emphasize and
discuss different locations, periodization, mechanisms, and
expressions of colonial power. With few exceptions, postco-
lonial thinkers focus geographically on Asia as the object of
the colonial imperial gaze and activity.^2 In contrast, decolonial
scholars focus on the Americas as the location for the colonial
expressions with which they engage. Postcolonial scholars take
the Enlightenment as the point of reference for analyzing both
“modernity” and colonization, whereas decolonial thinkers
trace modernity and the emergence of  [[colonialism]]  as far back
as  [[1492]] . In other words, there is a difference of periodization.
(^2) Fernando Coronil is a good example of a postcolonial thinker whose work
focuses on Latin America, specifically Venezuela. Similarly, Latina/o theo-
logian  [[May]] ra Rivera uses postcolonial theory and continental philosophy
to engage her Latina/o context. Others who have engaged postcolonial
scholarship, especially in the theological realm, are really reconfiguring lib-
eration philosophy and  [[theology]] . See (Rivera,  [[2007]] ) and (Coronil,  [[2004]] ).

Methodologically speaking, postcolonial scholars focus their
attention on the colonial gaze; it is the colonial subject that
figures prominently in their writings. Meanwhile, decolonial
thinkers look to those outside of the colonial centres of power.
It is the colonized, the others of  [[empire]] , that receive greater
attention. In other words, there is a difference of orientation
and directionality in each current. Similarly, postcolonial schol-
ars, with notable exceptions, focus particularly on issues of
representation and the imposition of  [[West]] ern imperial episte-
mologies. They draw from  [[Europe]] an post-structuralist thinkers,
remaining circumscribed by the very  [[Europe]] an intellectual
frames which they critique.^3 In contrast, decolonial scholars
aim at reclaiming the epistemic traditions of the colonized (See:
Mignolo,  [[2009]] ). They undertake a rejection of epistemic tradi-
tions rather than an interrogation of the epistemologies of the
centre.^4 Finally, and more fundamentally, postcolonial scholars
zero-in on coloniality as encompassing cultural imperialism,
while decolonial scholars emphasize coloniality as a force lead-
ing to: the violent genocidal eradication of the peoples and their
cultures; the enslavement of entire communities; and enormous
people movements (migration) as mechanisms for colonization
(Quijano,  [[2000]] ). Decolonial scholars also consider that colo-
niality is part and parcel of the present multiple globalizing
forms of capitalism. Coloniality is then manifested not only as
an imposed cultural force, but as encompassing all aspects of
human existence for all those involved; it embodies a colonial-
ity of power (Quijano,  [[2000]] ) and imposes a critical apparatus
within which the  [[Europe]] an intellectual tradition is celebrated
(^3) For example, it is commonly known that postcolonial scholars draw from the
work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, among others.
(^4) We are well aware of the Eurocentric character of the language of epistemol-
ogies. Among many decolonial scholars, there is a privileging of the notion of
saberes which incorporates a wide range of approaches by which peoples con-
struct knowledge that includes their wisdom traditions. See (Walsh,  [[2007]] ).

as the highest expression of human advance/achievement and
patterns of behaviour. These differences put on display a rich
conversation between these two currents that needs to be had
in greater detail at another time. But by contrasting postcolo-
nial and decolonial thinking, and while recognizing their crucial
points of intersection, we have begun to show how decolonial
thinking is more appropriate for our purposes.
Indigenous intellectuals, scholars, artists, and activists in
what is now Canada have already made enormous contributions
to these debates.^5 We are also well aware that there are many
initiatives, movements, and projects in Canada and elsewhere
that are not self-perceived as “decolonial” or self-described with
decolonial language along the lines of Latin  [[American]]  decolonial
thinking, but which follow in the spirit of this thematic direction.
In what follows, then, it is our intention to complement these
perspectives by showing how decolonial thinking can bring cru-
cial insights to the context of Canada. In  [[alliance]]  with Indigenous
scholars and others, we begin by affirming that the construction
of Canada as a nation is directly related to the events that began
in  [[1492]] . The ways in which colonial forces engaged Indigenous
communities encompassed: strategic attempts to dislocate them
from their lands, orchestrated moves toward their eradication
by way of military force (genocide), and organized attempts to
destroy their cultures and religious traditions (culturecide, e.g.
residential schools). The  [[history]]  of the  [[First Nations]] , Métis, and
Inuit peoples is violently inscribed in Canada’s invader-settler
 [[history]] . Secondly,  [[colonialism]]  in Canada introduced complex
power-plays beyond the moment of first contact, including in his-
torical conflicts between English- and  [[French]] -speaking sectors of
the country as well as in subsequent waves of immigration, the
effects of which we continue to feel even today. In other words,
the construction of Canada as a nation is intrinsically connected to

the  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an colonial project in the Americas; Canada’s
 [[history]]  and formation as a nation, in order to be understood
properly, needs to be resituated within this  [[American]]  continental
experience of  [[colonialism]] . In the context of Canada,  [[colonialism]]
meant the domination of the colonized “other.” On one hand,
Canada needs to come to terms with the very structures of col-
onization which continue to disproportionately benefit specific
sectors of the Euro- [[Canadian]]  population. On the other hand,
Canada will also have to confront its multicultural façade which
claims that official  [[multiculturalism]]  celebrates diversity without
prejudice when in fact it actually excludes those who do not fit
the dominant/normative Euro- [[Canadian]]  frame.
Our work comes out of our experiences as a Latino- [[Canadian]]
immigrant and a  white   [[Canadian]]  settler. Our identities
embody the complex strands of interwoven stories in relation
to these histories and experiences of coloniality. Between us
and in different yet interconnected ways we have experienced:
the pervasiveness of  [[colonialism]]  in political, social and racial-
ized realities; the destructive effects of  [[colonialism]]  as part of
the long-standing  [[history]]  of the construction of Canada as a
nation; and the hope of working across difference to build rela-
tionship and community. We have engaged these issues in the
academy, in the churches, in various community settings, and
in a variety of artistic collaborations. It thus rises out of our
communities of engagement and reflects the ongoing conver-
sation between us about these issues.
(Re) Situating Canada in the Context
of (Global) Coloniality (and the
Modern-Colonial  [[World]]  System)
Canada’s inability to deal with diverse cultural groups is
certainly not new. There is a long-standing  [[history]]  of racialized
and xenophobic attitudes in Canada. Such racialized atti-
tudes, however, are part of a larger complex of international

and geopolitical colonializing power relations. To be able to
understand present racialized configurations and their con-
crete structures and expressions in Canada, it is necessary to
situate them within the context of the global colonial project.
Such a move requires an unmasking of the geo-political power
negotiations that have contributed both to the construction
of the  [[Canadian]]  nation-state and the historical imaginary of
Canada. These constructions have by-and-large contributed to
the myth of Canada as a benign, welcoming, generous, peace-
keeping, multicultural nation, almost a u[[top]]ic example for the
rest of the world to look towards. At the same time, Canada
has functioned and has seen itself, in many ways, as an exten-
sion of  [[Europe]] , as part of the  [[British]]  Empire. On both counts,
Canada has succeeded in postponing having to deal with its
own racist  [[history]] , and, as a result,  [[Canadian]] s have not had to
deal substantively with the underside of their colonial past.^6
On the flip side, Canada’s trajectory as a nation may also be
clearly understood as one of the locations for the realization of
the colonial project. It is an object of colonial desire—its land
to be extracted and settled and its peoples to be invaded and
 [[conquer]] ed as part of the story of the “discovery” and  [[conquer]] -
ing of the Americas (Medina,  [[2017]] ).
Latin  [[American]]  decolonial scholars describe the con-
ceptual framework that subsumes the co-constitutive axes
of  [[colonialism]] , modernity and capitalism as coloniality.
They understand “coloniality,” including the modern/
colonial capitalist world-system, as the systemic residue of
(^6) One exceptional case which has taken centre stage recently is the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) process in relation to residential
schools for Indigenous peoples in Canada. It remains to be seen, however,
how many of the recommendations from the TRC will be implemented.
Furthermore, the TRC and the processes that led up to it have not led to
the recognition of the broader  [[history]]  of exercising colonial power over
other ethnocultural groups.

 [[colonialism]]  and its ongoing manifestation in present glo-
balizing, neoliberal systems.^7 Decolonial scholars, along
with some cultural theorists and anthropologists, insist
that “modern”  [[history]] , and especially the “success” and
“superiority” of  [[Europe]] an culture/modernity, can only be
understood if the conquest of the Americas,  [[plantation]]
 [[slavery]]  and the emergence of globalizing forms of capital-
ism are understood as co-constitutive.^8 In addition, they
argue that the claim of modernity’s success and the self-
proclaimed superiority of  [[Europe]]  must be interrogated
from the perspective of the peoples upon whom moder-
nity was built and  [[Europe]] an “civilization” was imposed,
in other words, from the perspective of the vanquished
(Dussel,  [[1995]] ).
(^7) Nelson Maldonado-Torres distinguishes between  [[colonialism]]  and coloni-
ality, asserting that “ [[colonialism]]  denotes a political and economic relation in
which the  [[sovereignty]]  of a nation or a people rests on the power of another
nation, which makes such nation an  [[empire]] . Coloniality, instead, refers to
long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of  [[colonialism]] ,
but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge pro-
duction well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations” (Nelson
Maldonado-Torres,  [[2007]] , 70, 242).
(^8) Decolonial scholars use Immanuel Wallerstein’s notion of the modern
world-system, expanding it to include the reality of coloniality, thus “the
modern-colonial world-system.” (Mignolo,  [[2000]] , 18). Decolonial perspec-
tives also put forth similar arguments to those by cultural theorists like
scholars Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, but they differ radically in their focus.
Paul Gilroy, for instance, in The Black  [[Atlantic]]  , argues that Anglo Euro- [[North]]
 [[American]]  modernity and its capitalist systems and exploits cannot be
accurately considered without acknowledging the essential centrality and
barbarity of  [[plantation]]   [[slavery]]  in modernity’s inception and fabric. (Gilroy,
and (Hall,  [[2000]] , 184–227). By contrast, decolonial scholars empha-
      size the Indigenous underside of  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an “modernity” and
      underscore more broadly the colonial foundation and character of  [[West]] ern
       [[Europe]] an epistemologies. (See Dussel,  [[1995]] ).

We argue that Canada, as a settler  [[colony]] /nation which
emerged from the  [[British]]  and  [[French]]  invasions of the region,
is a product of this modern-colonial world-system. Despite this
reality, Canada remains largely outside theoretical post/deco-
lonial discourses; the issues, concerns and social implications
are still largely unengaged. The result has often been to view
Canada as not having any negative colonial  [[history]] , while Canada
itself continues to perpetuate an ongoing “denial and margin-
alization of  [[Native]]  people’s experience of  [[colonialism]]  as well
as of the invader-settler and immigrant experiences” (Brydon,
 [[2004]] , 173). Indeed, cultural realities in a  [[Canadian]]  context are
extremely complex, contested and  [[flu]] id, shaped by a wide range
of dynamic, shifting and multiple identities often within the
same person or community. The resulting complexity is that
the “inherited identities as  [[First Nations]] , Métis,  [[Québec]] ois,
invader-settler, immigrant, or ‘ethnic’” are intricately interwo-
ven with the reality of coloniality (Brydon,  [[2004]] , 171).
Yet even these categories are problematic because they
are framed within the colonial understanding of identities as
finished products, which tends to undermine the complex pro-
cesses involved in the historical encounters of peoples. Identity
categories themselves function as mechanisms for population
control, aimed at keeping people within their identity silos,
which are organized hierarchically. Those people that stand
in-between ethnocultural traditions, because of pervasive
dominant colonial identity frameworks, are often forced to
deny the  [[flu]] id and ambivalent ways in which they understand
themselves in public sphere. In the private sphere, however,
they continue to carve and negotiate creative, celebratory, and
often subversive social spaces which spill out into the public
sphere as well (Medina,  [[2013]] ).
Notions of national identity are no less contested, par-
ticularly in the context of Canada and its connections to the
 [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an colonial project. In the  [[Canadian]]  context,
the dominant imaginary denies Canada’s complicity with

the colonial project. In fact, there is a long-standing  [[history]]
of complicity with  [[colonialism]]  by which Canada proudly
imagines itself as an extension of  [[Europe]] . Canada’s social,
political and international imaginary exhibits a pride about
its connection to this colonial legacy. The colonial umbilical
cord with  [[Europe]]  has not been severed. At the same time,
there is a sophisticated ideological apparatus at play, by
which Canada intentionally conceals its own colonial com-
plicity through the creation of national myths.
The preeminent myth that both perpetuates and hides
Canada’s colonial legacy is the idea of  [[multiculturalism]] , as
a u[[top]]ic society and nation, in which the diversity of ethno-
cultural identities is celebrated. Scholars range in the ways
they understand-engage Canada’s policy of  [[multiculturalism]] .
For example, Charles Taylor critiques the universal applica-
tion of the idea of “human dignity” along with the idea of the
universal worth of cultural traditions in  [[multiculturalism]] . He
claims that behind the affirmation of the universal worth of
cultural groups is their homogenization under  [[North]]   [[Atlantic]]
criteria (Taylor,  [[1992]] , 71). In contrast, Himani Bannerji cri-
tiques the ideal of  [[multiculturalism]]  because it perpetuates the
power differential between the official Euro- [[Canadian]]  cultures
and everyone else. As she puts it,  [[multiculturalism]]  advocating
for “minorities” actually (re)inscribes their minoritized sta-
tus (Bannerji,  [[2000]] ). From an Indigenous perspective, Glen
Coulthard critiques the very idea of recognition politics as the
basis for a transformation of the “colonial relationship between
Indigenous people and the  [[Canadian]]  nation state.” He writes
that “instead of ushering in an era of peaceful coexistence
grounded on the ideal of reciprocity or mutual recognition , the
politics of recognition in its contemporary liberal form prom-
ises to reproduce the very configurations of colonialist, racist,
patriarchal state power that Indigenous peoples’ demands for
recognition have historically sought to transcend (Coulthard,
 [[2014]] , 3). Other scholars also highlight the character of

 [[multiculturalism]]  as a tool to manage the population and struc-
ture  [[Canadian]]  society.^9
By perpetuating the myth of  [[multiculturalism]]  and its attend-
ing politics of recognition, attempts at unmasking ongoing
realities of racism, xenophobia, and  white  supremacy are seen
as social maladies which  [[Canadian]] s have already overcome.
As a result, people who raise concerns about these realities
are stigmatized as disgruntled and are accused of unearthing
issues that are part of a time long gone. Multiculturalism, then,
functions as the governing social imaginary which promotes
the idea that it is possible to construct a society where ethno-
cultural differences are welcome as long as minoritized people
learn to function within the scope of the dominant “ white ”
Euro  [[Canadian]]  (English- and  [[French]] -speaking) culture(s),
including Indigenous peoples and all other “others.”  White ness
remains the ubiquitous feature, framework, and point of
reference—though it is absent from the official rhetoric—and is
“synthesized into a national we,” which decides “on the terms of
 [[multiculturalism]]  and the degree to which multicultural others
should be tolerated or accommodated. This ‘we’ is an essential-
ized version of a colonial  [[Europe]] an turned into  [[Canadian]]  and
the subject or the agent of  [[Canadian]]  nationalism” (Bannerji,
 [[2000]] , 42–43). The implication is that coloniality is constitu-
tive of Canada as a nation. Admittedly, Canada as a nation has
made some strides towards becoming a more hospitable nation
to Indigenous communities and diverse ethnocultural commu-
nities, including immigrants. Those changes, however, are not
the result of a commitment to the inclusion of different peo-
ples and cultures in the very fabric of  [[Canadian]]  culture,  [[history]] ,
and imaginary. Rather, they have taken place because of the
struggles of Indigenous peoples and other ethnocultural com-
munities against the pervasive structures of discrimination.

Unsanitizing Canada’s Legacy
Re-situating Canada, along the lines of Latin  [[American]]  deco-
lonial thinkers, within the broader colonial legacy affirms the
fact that the  [[British]]  colonial impetus, English coloniality, is at
the heart of the formation of Canada as a nation. The construc-
tion of a positive self-understanding of Canada as proudly part of
the  [[British]]  Empire, part of the  [[British]]  colonial commonwealth, is
unmasked. Reestablishing Canada’s long  [[history]]  of colonial con-
nections names the multiplicity of issues that come with its birth
as a nation-state. It is rooted in the initial encounters with origi-
nary peoples in the Americas, post  [[1492]] , which became violent
and resulted in the decimation of the Indigenous peoples, cul-
tures, and traditions. Though first established as an outpost of
colonial  [[empire]] , Canada was subsequently built and continues to
be built by diverse and complex waves of immigration. These waves
which continue even today have significantly impacted the ongoing
formation of the country. However, along with the attempted eras-
ure of the narratives of Indigenous peoples, the contributions of
many of these groups remain absent from the dominant narrative
of the nation building  [[history]] . The retrieval of the multiple stories
of the various waves of immigrants helps us see that Canada was
not built by “ white s” alone. It was and continues to be built on
the backs of the “others” of the colonial project. Recognizing
Canada’s multiple histories unhinges the  [[Canadian]]  story from
the monocultural narrative of  [[empire]] .
Canada as a nation did not really begin in  [[1867]]  with the
 [[British]]   [[North]]  America  Act. Rather, Canada is the result of
long standing processes of colonization that date as far back
as the arrival of the  [[French]]  and the  [[British]]  to the region and
are connected to the larger  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an imperial pro-
jects initiated by the  [[Spanish]]  and Portuguese from  [[1492]]  on.
Like the  [[Spanish]]  and Portuguese, although with marked dif-
ferences, the  [[French]]  and the  [[British]]  imposed their ideas of
civilization and cultural superiority upon Indigenous peoples.

On one hand, the  [[Spanish]]  and Portuguese used military
violence as strategies to annihilate and to displace Indigenous
peoples from their lands and to subdue Indigenous resistance.
On the other, the  [[French]]  and  [[British]]  began by negotiating
(though not without some acts of violence) and gradually
turned to systematic methods of cultural subjugation, includ-
ing but not limited to the violation of  [[treaty]]  agreements and
the residential school system. The relationship that the  [[French]]
and  [[British]]  sought at first with Indigenous peoples was circum-
scribed by colonial structures. It was an uneven relationship; it
imposed the  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an colonial rule-of-law to shape
the nature of the relationship in the form of  [[treaties]] , which
the  [[Canadian]]   [[government]]  violated by reneging on its com-
mitment. Religion was a central part of the colonial project
throughout the Americas as enculturated  [[Europe]] an versions of
Christianity were forcefully imposed upon Indigenous commu-
nities. In Canada, the civilizing thrust of Christianity eventually
contributed to the formation of the residential schools. The
complicity of the Christian religious establishment with the
 [[government]] ’s aim to control and civilize Indigenous peoples
cannot be overstated. All this is to say that the colonial project
reached into all dimensions of Indigenous life, including the
cultural, political, social, and the religious.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce Canada’s colonial
 [[history]]  to only the initial encounter with Indigenous people
and subsequent developments in policies of marginalization
and social exclusion like the  [[Indian]]  Act and the establishment of
reservations and the residential schools. What is now Canada
was also built and continues to be built by immigrants. Yet,
not all immigrants have been valued to the same degree, a fact
which is unmasked by considering the nation’s troubled  [[history]]
in dealing with the diversity of its cultural groups. There are
many examples of discrimination including, among others: the
 [[Chinese]]  immigration Act ( [[1923]] ), also known as the  [[Chinese]]
exclusion act; the use of indentured  [[child]]  labour from  [[Britain]]

in the 19th century ( [[British]]  home  [[child]] ren, the Bernardo chil-
dren); the internment of Germans and Hungarian  [[Canadian]] s
during the first world war; the internment and confiscation of
 [[property]]  of  [[Japanese]]   [[Canadian]] s during world war two; the dis-
crimination against  [[Africa]] n- [[Canadian]] s ( [[Nova Scotia]] ,  [[1946]] );
the rabid Jewish antisemitism in  [[Quebec]]  in the second half of
the twentieth century; and the importing of domestic and tem-
porary/seasonal workers from the Caribbean, the Philippines,
and Latin America among other places from the  [[1950]] s to the
present day.
Two important insights can be gleaned from this list.
First, the notion of “ white ness” does not point to a homo-
geneous group as can be seen by the discriminatory policies
directed towards “ white ” poor/orphaned  [[British]]   [[child]] ren
and the internment of Germans, Hungarians and  [[Italian]] s,
for instance.  White ness is a chameleon-like social, politi-
cal, economic construction of ethno-cultural identity tied
to the  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an racialized colonial apparatus and
designed to exclude and assimilate. Second,  white ness oper-
ates as a normative value system that establishes hierarchies
among ethnic groups. As a result, people from groups who
are racialized tend to fare worse in the long run. Furthermore,
it almost goes without saying that  white ness, like any
other discriminatory structure, is compounded when other
identity markers, like gender, class, dis/ability, education,
nationality, sexual orientation, age, accent, and other factors
are taken into account. Decolonial thinkers remind us that
even these categories are marked by the fact that they have
been constructed within  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an epistemological
framing.^10
(^10) Suffice it to say a fuller analysis of the implication of these questions is
too large for discussion here. See for example (Walsh,  [[2007]] ) and (Medina,
 [[2018]] ).

The ugly colonial  [[history]]  of Canada is intricately woven with
(cultural and ethno-racial)  white ness as the preferred (predomi-
nant) Eurocentric norm for all its inhabitants. Set in place are
social structures and a historical imaginary designed to continu-
ally reinforce Canada’s colonial identity. As Celia Haig-Brown
argues, “simple binary distinctions... fail to address the range
of ways that people are a part of this country” (Haig-Brown,  [[2009]] ,
14). Though all immigrants are implicated in processes of colo-
nization, they are not all implicated in the “same ways as those
who came with the clear intention of exploitation and profit.
Many people came for better lives, to escape war and famine, to
seek freedom, to start anew” (Haig-Brown,  [[2009]] ). People come
to Canada for a number of different reasons: as political and eco-
nomic refugees, as s [[kill]] ed labour, as investors. But Canada also
exercises its power to entice immigrants and temporary workers,
while preventing them from becoming actual residents in the
country. These dynamics are part of the way in which colonial
economic power is played out in and by Canada.
Unsanitizing Canada’s  [[history]]  confronts this “historical con-
text of the founding and grounding violence of the  [[Canadian]]
state—violence directed toward many immigrant and enslaved
peoples, as well as toward Indigenous peoples” (Shotwell,  [[2015]] ,
65).^11 It unmasks our colonial legacy and exposes the u[[top]]ic myth
of Canada as a benign multicultural nation. Everyone’s presence
in Canada is touched by coloniality. It is our collective  [[history]] .
And it is a  [[history]]  by which some of us have benefited greatly
(^11) For Shotwell, a process of “unforgetting,” especially for  white  Anglo
 [[Canadian]] s, who benefit from  white  systemic privilege, is necessary in order
to combat the “colonial status quo [which] involves truly vast apparatuses
and histories” (65). She notes that a “central feature of  white  settler colo-
nial subjectivity is forgetting; we live  white ness in part as active ignorance
and forgetting” (58). She also notes that “unforgetting” is only effective
when it is coupled with a commitment to action “to craft a future different
than the horrific past we have inherited and live in the present” (58).

in terms of wealth and status, while others—those condemned
( damnés) to the colonial underside—have experienced oppres-
sion, impoverishment, racism, violence and even  [[death]]  (Fanon,
 [[1963]] ). Colonial power structures depend on a wide range of fac-
tors, codes, and processes in which  white ness has been one of
the most salient features. More recently though, with the open-
ness to immigration from countries of the Global  [[South]] , class
and education have gained greater importance. The chameleon
changes its colours to ensure that the colonial apparatus stays
intact through coloniality, in whatever form it needs to take.
This operative colonial power matrix which includes social
and cultural  white ness, among other things, shapes society and
includes our sources of knowledge and ways of being which
are part of what decolonial scholars articulate more broadly
as a “coloniality of being” and “coloniality of knowledge”
(Maldonado-Torres,  [[2007]] ; Walsh,  [[2007]] ). Nelson Maldonado-
Torres writes that the interconnected forces of colonial power
impact our intersubjective relations as we come to grips with
the “effects of coloniality in lived experience and not only in
the mind” (Maldonado-Torres,  [[2007]] , 242). In other words,
coloniality shapes and prescribes the way individuals ought to
behave in a society. He argues that a coloniality of being “is
maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic perfor-
mance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image
of peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects
of our modern experience. In a way, as modern subjects we
breathe coloniality all the time and every day” (Maldonado-
Torres,  [[2007]] , 243).
Maldonado-Torres proposes a number of strategic possibilities
for decolonization including: borrowing from Fanon—receptive
generosity in which “racialized subjects could give and receive
freely;” suspending one’s identity and offering “one’s life to the
task of achieving decolonial justice;” dialogue and exchange;
confronting the “racial, gender, and sexual hierarchies that were
put in place by  [[Europe]] an modernity as it colonized and enslaved

populations throughout the planet;” and opposing the paradigm
of war (Maldonado-Torres,  [[2007]] , 60–62). However, Maldonado-
Torres’ insightful proposal is less help in the context of Canada
where the notion of  [[multiculturalism]]  is deployed paradoxically
both as a tool to celebrate diversity and as a mechanism for rein-
scribing the inherited  white  Anglo  [[North]]   [[Atlantic]]  mode of being
as normative. In our view, Nelson-Maldonado’s proposal runs
the risk of romanticizing the work of decolonization but leaves
unchallenged the subtle, complex and hard to detect mechanisms
of coloniality. Taking these factors into account, we argue that,
in the context of Canada, coloniality of being not only affects our
sense of personal and community identity as we have articulated
them, but also impacts that way  [[Canadian]] s understand them-
selves as a nation.
Canada as the Subject and Object of Colonial
Desire
Canada’s geopolitical position and status in the global mar-
ket allows it to become an instrument of colonial power both in
its internal and external capacity to act on smaller players, but
also to be acted upon, by the  [[U.S.A.]]  and  [[Britain]] , for example. It
is for this reason that any consideration of the present  [[Canadian]]
context necessitates an evaluation of the ways in which Canada
aspires to function in the global scene imitating present global
economic and military powers. As we have been arguing, Canada
is marked by coloniality through and through and needs to be
understood as located in the Americas, historically, geo-politically
and culturally. At the same time, we wish to show that while
Canada participates in the colonial project and benefits from the
present geopolitical configuration, it simultaneously occupies
an in-between identity space as a nation in which it displays
elements of being a colonized society as well. In the larger
interconnected web of historical and present-day colonial pow-
ers, Canada is both a subject and object of colonial desire.

Canada is the subject of colonial desire because it strategi-
cally draws from patterns of behaviour by more powerful actors
which continue the legacy of  [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an  [[North]]   [[Atlantic]]
imperialism, especially the  [[U.S.A.]]  and  [[Britain]] . It adopts colo-
nizing strategies that seek to reproduce this behaviour in order
to organize itself as a society and as a way to participate in the
larger global theatre. It is not difficult to see how Canada tai-
lors itself after these countries. For example, former  [[Canadian]]
 [[Prime Minister]]  Stephen Harper mimicked a  [[U.S.A.]] -style
presidency by limiting “his access to the media, keeping some-
thing of a distance, [and] controlling what would be known
and said,” making a show of his trip to Afghanistan, invoking
the Christian God in a  [[U.S.A.]] -style “God bless Canada,” and
staging the speech from the throne more as a media-hyped
State of the Union-style address (Haberman,  [[2006]] ). According
to Arthur Harberman, this behaviour of Harper’s in which
he acted like the  [[U.S.A.]]  head of state violated the  [[Canadian]]
 [[parliament]] ary approach in which he is rather the head of a
party and a Member of Parliament, like all the other Members,
responsible to the  [[Crown]]  as head of state. Of course, there is a
significant irony in the fact that Canada’s head of state is still
the  [[Queen]]  of England.
This aspiration towards  [[Britain]]  is exemplified in recent con-
troversies related to the required swearing of the oath to the
 [[Queen]]  at citizenship ceremonies. In a  [[Globe and Mail]]  article
which documents the legal case of three would-be citizens who,
for ethical and religious reasons do not wish to swear such an
allegiance, argues in its favour, concluding that “The  [[Crown]]  is
a powerful and historic symbol. Far from diminishing  [[Canadian]]
citizenship, it enhances Canada” ( [[Globe and Mail]] ,  [[2017]] ). Emer
O’Toole, another would-be- [[Canadian]] , writes in an op-ed for
the Guardian that his socialist beliefs make the allegiance
“anathema to my political con [[science]] ; I’m baffled by otherwise
egalitarian people who are okay with aristocrats inheriting the
position of head of state.” O’Toole continues by articulating the

coloniality behind this symbolic gesture. He writes “As an  [[Irish]]
person, I’m aware of the historical oppression of my people and
culture by  [[British]]   [[colonialism]] ” (O’Toole,  [[2014]] ).
In both instances Canada’s complicity with coloniality is
exposed and problematized. The  [[U.S.A.]]  and  [[Britain]]  function as
an idealized double-optic which continues to shape Canada’s
self-perception inside and outside. Canada’s imaginary (social,
political, economic, cultural, etc.. .) is governed by a type of
coloniality of being which simultaneously imitates and imposes
colonizing social behaviours. Of course, a fuller discussion
of the dynamics at play and the factors contributing to these
dynamics go beyond the scope of this article. Our examples
merely touch the surface of a much more complicated network
of historical, social, political, cultural, and economic factors
and issues that continue to shape  [[Canadian]]  self-perception
and from which Canada and  [[Canadian]] s benefit enormously;
ability to travel overseas, level of and access to education and
wealth, healthcare, etc. However, they serve to illustrate how
the dynamics of coloniality operate even at the highest lev-
els of  [[government]] . They also illustrate the profoundly cultural
nature of coloniality which permeates all levels of society and
inevitably has detrimental effects on entire sectors of the pop-
ulation, especially racialized peoples, in some of the ways we
have shown.
Conversely,  [[Canadian]] s also find themselves existing in a
liminal space, vulnerable to  [[U.S.A.]]  and  [[British]]  colonializing
whims. Canada is looked at paternalistically as being a young
nation when compared to its progenitor/motherland,  [[Britain]] ,
and is bullied by its older brother to the  [[South]] , the  [[U.S.A.]]  Alan
Lawson describes this position as being “suspended between
‘mother’ and ‘other,’ simultaneously colonized and coloniz-
ing” (Lawson,  [[2004]] , 155) and Lee Maracle writes that “we
are the grand [[child]] ren of an abusive industrial  [[British]]  parent”
(Maracle,  [[2004]] , 206). We do not have to go too far to find
examples in the political realm. As a constitutional monarchy

and member of the  [[British]]  Commonwealth, Canada’s iden-
tity as a nation is still geopolitically situated in relation to the
 [[British]]  Empire and it resides under the shadow of the present
tempestuous president of the  [[U.S.A.]]  The dismissal of Canada
by President Trump in anticipation of  [[NAFTA]]  negotiations
shows the little value the  [[U.S.A.]]  gives to Canada’s  [[sovereignty]]
(Dale,  [[2017]] ). There is a long  [[history]]  of historical subjugation
by  [[Britain]]  and interventionism by the  [[U.S.A.]]  Canada finds
itself deeply in [[flu]] enced, historically, economically and cultur-
ally, by the over-bearing and paternalistic attitudes and actions
of these two nations. Caught between,  [[Canadian]] s find them-
selves in a perpetual search for their  [[Canadian]]  “identity.”
The Implications of Reading Coloniality in
Canada
In our view, coloniality operates as a range of expressions
in which  [[empire]]  manifests its power in very concrete ways
that we are still experiencing. The present configuration of
Canada’s imaginary along with its systems of education and
its social, political, and economic structures are predicated on
inherited colonizing frames which perpetuate the exclusion of,
discrimination against, and violence towards those who have
been and are othered in ongoing processes that began 500
years ago. We affirm a decolonial stance which involves the
undoing and unlearning of the strategies, approaches, meth-
ods and tendencies that wittingly or unwittingly reproduce
this coloniality in all its manifestations. It also involves a sys-
tematic interrogation of the wide range of power structures,
consumption, and profit-making which govern all human rela-
tions. With others, we dare to confront Canada’s coloniality
with all of its attendant discriminatory hierarchies, practices,
and systems (racism, sexism, etc.. .) “not [only] as regretful
by-products of modern  [[Europe]] , but as part of the conditions
that made... [Canada]... possible (Lander,  [[2000]] , 525).

According to Roxana Ng, racist, sexist, and xenophobic roots
“underpin the construction of Canada as a nation. This racism
began in Canada with the interventions of  [[Europe]] ans convinced
of their superiority to Indigenous peoples” (Haig-Brown,  [[2009]] ,
8). Engaging this inheritance and facing the fact that colonial-
ity is constitutive of Canada’s  [[history]] , Canada’s formation as a
nation, Canada’s identity as a nation-state, as well as the way
 [[Canadian]] s understand themselves and each other in relation to
these factors, would involve a decolonial turn towards those who
inhabit the underside of coloniality. Himani Bannerji articulates
such a move, stating that “the possibility for constructing a radi-
cally different Canada emerge only from those who have been
“othered” as the insider-outsiders of the nation... They serve
to remind us of the Canada that could exist” (Bannerji,  [[2004]] ,
297). This “other” Canada goes beyond a liberal recognition of
the others of Empire to include a reclaiming and celebrating of
other epistemologies—the forms of knowledge of Indigenous
peoples and other ethnocultural groups, a process which is
already underway, as we have seen. It confronts the fact that the
very way Canada has constructed its epistemologies is based on
 [[West]] ern  [[Europe]] an rationalist Enlightenment thinking.^12
Conclusion
 [[July]]  1,  [[2017]]  marked the moment of Canada’s deeply con-
tested 150th anniversary since confederation first took place. A
rich diversity of voices merged in the public sphere to mark the
(^12) According to Catherine Walsh, in our present context of “shifting geo-
political knowledges,” the decolonial turn will include “a renovation and
reconstruction of critical thought in ways that take into account the present-
day relations between culture, politics, and economy, [and that] challenge the
hegemony of Eurocentric perspectives, and promote dialogues and thinking
with thought and knowledge ‘others’, including that of Afro and Indigenous
social movements and intellectuals” (Walsh,  [[2007]] , 233).

occasion. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, a group of
five “ white ” military men, self-described as “Proud Boys” who
are “ [[West]] ern Chauvinists” disrupted a peaceful  [[protest]]  on
Canada Day by Mi-kmaq (Indigenous) women in  [[Halifax]] , Nova
Scotia, by yelling “this is a  [[British]]  Colony.” The women, who
were honouring murdered and missing Indigenous women
were “trying to help, heal, and mourn” (Lagerquist,  [[July]]  3,
 [[2017]] ).^13 Other voices ran the gamut from romantically declar-
ing that “at 150, Canada is a far better place, in a far better
space than ever before — in a world that grows only worse,”
to those who confronted the painful reality of racism and the
difficulty of fitting in to the normative  white -Anglo expecta-
tions of “ [[Canadian]] ” identity (Cohn,  [[2017]] ; Jackson et al,  [[2017]] ;
Paradkar,  [[2017]] ). In the wake of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and its recommendations, many Indigenous
voices and allies called for  [[protest]] s  against the celebrations
noting that Indigenous communities have little to celebrate
(Saganash,  [[2017]] ; Morin,  [[2017]] ).
Significantly and hopefully, as we cross the threshold of
this 150th anniversary, even those who are inclined to be sen-
timental and romantic admit that it is necessary for Canada
to acknowledge our racialized and gendered violent and trau-
matic past. For instance, powerful and compelling voices are
calling on  [[Canadian]] s and their  [[government]]  to take concrete
steps towards tangible reconciliation, daring to contemplate
the possibilities of constructing another Canada, “for all of us,
our first people and our most recently arrived people and those
 [[Canadian]] s yet to come” (Keenan,  [[2017]] ). We argue that this
“other” Canada requires a task of decolonization which engen-
ders the development of new attitudes towards all “others” of/
in Canada and depends on building movements of solidarity,
(^13) Subsequent reports indicate that the military will remove the men from
duty and training pending an investigation and called their actions deplor-
able. (Lagerquist,  [[July]]  4,  [[2017]] ).

 [[alliance]] , and resistance between Indigenous peoples, immi-
grants, racialized people, and allies. The ethnocultural mosaic
that “makes Canada great,” and was widely celebrated as the
nation turned 150, also has, as part of its historical narrative,
a legacy of exploitation, oppression, and genocide. The pres-
ence of such a rich ethnocultural diversity forces us to rethink
inherited forms of social and political organization that privi-
lege a small racialized sector of the country. It invites us to
reinvent social, political, intellectual, and economic structures
in ways that counter the various forms of coloniality while
seeking ways to make Canada accountable for its complic-
ity in the present forces of globalizing neoliberal capitalism.
Recognizing Canada’s rich diversity also means uncovering
the rich range of sources of human knowledge as well as cul-
tural and social resources with which to construct a national
intercultural imaginary of Canada as a welcoming home for
the many. It is time for Canada to confront the skeletons in its
closet, abandon the relics of imperialism and colonization, and
to decolonize itself by truly embracing all its peoples.
