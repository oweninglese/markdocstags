Abstract
In  [[2012]], the Harper  [[government]] launched a national celebration of the bicentennial of
the  War of  [[1812]], even though few  [[Canadian]]s were aware of the anniversary or of the
war itself. While commemorating a largely unknown war might at first seem counter
intuitive, this article argues that the focus on the  War of  [[1812]] represented an oppor
tunity to engage in the construction of a different  [[Canadian]] identity. In effect, the
narrative surrounding the  War of  [[1812]] celebrations permitted the Conservative gov
ernment to begin to establish a new "warrior identity" in contrast to the "peacekeeping
identity" that has been associated with liberal internationalism and the Liberal Party.
While liberal internationalism in both the study and practice of  [[Canadian]] foreign policy
contributed to a national identity framed around shared internationalist values, the
narratives presented during the  War of  [[1812]] celebrations suggest an alter[[native]] under
standing of the "true" nature of  [[Canadian]] identity.

The  War of  [[1812]] was a seminal event in the making of our great country...
 [[June]]  [[2012]] will mark 200 years since the declaration of the  War of  [[1812]]—a war
that saw  [[Aboriginal]] peoples, local and volunteer militias, and English and  [[French]]
speaking regiments fight together to save Canada from  [[American]] invasion.
The  War helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country,
united under the  [[Crown]] with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity. The heroic

efforts of  [[Canadian]]s then helped define who we are today, what side of the border we
live on, and which flag we salute.'
With these words,  [[Prime Minister]] Stephen Harper began to establish the broad
outlines of an emergent national identity, an identity expressed through
Canada's foreign policy and foreign  [[wars]]—both "old" and new. Despite a cli
mate of fiscal austerity, budget cutting, and the downsizing of the federal public
service, the  [[government]] of Canada chose to spend between approximately $
and $40 million2 during  [[2012]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of the  War
of  [[1812]]. A special  [[silver]] dollar coin, a new national monument on Parliament
Hill, funding for historical re-enactments, upgrades for historic sites, museum
exhibits at the National  War Museum, and even a mobile phone app were
among the ways  [[Canadian]] taxpayer dollars were mobilized to support the cele
bration of the anniversary.3 Heritage Minister James Moore defended the deci
sion to spend millions of dollars by pointing to the growth in popular interest in
the  War of  [[1812]] since the  [[government]] had launched its commemoration plans.
" [[Canadian]]s are realizing that it is something that should be recognized across
the country, not just in the regions where the  [[battle]]s took place," he said.
Moore went on to argue that even if people wanted to debate the wisdom of
the  [[government]]'s investment, "it's an essential role for  [[government]] to remind
 [[Canadian]]s what unites us."
For Moore, the commemoration of the  War of  [[1812]] was an exercise conceived
in part to remind  [[Canadian]]s of what and who they are as a people. The commem
oration was justified, among other reasons, by the  [[government]]'s perception of
a lack of emphasis placed on the teaching of  [[Canadian]]  [[history]] in high schools.
As a result, argued Minister Moore, "it falls upon all of us who have a passionate
belief in  [[Canadian]]  [[history]], who have a deep feeling that we should be doing a better
job of educating our  [[kids]], to take advantage of moments like this [the bicentennial
of the  War of  [[1812]]],"5 notwithstanding the fact that high school curricula are not
under federal jurisdiction. Through the bicentennial celebrations, the  [[Canadian]]
 [[government]] cast itself as  [[history]] teacher, underlining the importance of "these
historic moments" and of educating "our  [[kids]] about the greatness that Canada
has known, the struggles that we've seen, and the things that unite us

Figures from the Government of Canada indicate that spending on the  [[1812]] commemoration was
   somewhat in excess of $28 million, while other commentators reported spending in excess of $
   million (see, for example, Jeffrey Simpson, "Has the war of  [[1812]] been overhyped?"  [[Ottawa]] Citizen,
   8  [[November]]  [[2012]], All).

going forward."6 As if to confirm the necessity of this educative mission, a com
prehensive survey conducted by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives Inc. for the
Department of National Defence revealed that "few people who took part in the
survey, and in related focus groups, were aware of the anniversary, and even fewer
could identify the  War of  [[1812]] by name." The  [[research]]ers went on to note that
"typically, no more than one or two participants in each [focus] group were aware
that this year is the bicentennial commemoration of the  War of  [[1812]], and these
people tended to deduce this with simple arithmetic. From the year,  [[1812]], they
made the logical leap to the  War of  [[1812]]. Most focus group participants had no
prior awareness of this anniversary."
This article begins to unpack the ways in which the commemoration of the
 War of  [[1812]] represents an exercise in identity reconstruction. The efforts of the
Conservative  [[government]] to rescue the war from the obscurity of being a
"mostly forgotten war, except by the handful of professional historians on
both sides of the Canada-US border, and the handfuls of people who live
near  [[battle]]grounds of yore"8 are worthy of some note.9 The war celebrated
by the Harper  [[government]] throughout  [[2012]] as a "watershed moment" in
 [[Canadian]]  [[history]] took place decades before Canada became a sovereign state,
empowered with the right to make its own policies, including its own foreign
policy. As Jeffrey Simpson has noted, the celebration of Canada's military
prowess in this war ignores the fact that in  [[1812]], "[t]here was no  [[Canadian]]
army, although there were  [[Canadian]] volunteers serving with the  [[British]], for the
 [[Canadian]] colonies were governed by the  [[British]]." Further, the argument that
"by frustrating the  [[American]]s, Canada was saved as a sovereign nation" belies
the fact that "there was no such thing as a sovereign  [[Canadian]] nation at the
time of the war."10 Finding the roots of what unites  [[Canadian]]s from a time
when Canada did not exist as a sovereign state—much less a unified nation—
must be understood as a distinctly political strategy. If the Harper  [[government]]
had wanted to celebrate an important event in  [[Canadian]]  [[history]] in the year
 [[2012]], for whatever reasons of national unity or harmony, it had other choices:
 [[2012]] marked the 50th anniversary of the introduction of medicare in
Saskatchewan, as well as the 30th anniversary of the  [[Canadian]] Charter of
Rights and Freedoms. As Simpson has remarked, "[p]oll after poll, seeking to
discover which symbols are most important for  [[Canadian]]s, reveal the [[top]] two

It is interesting to note that even for those living in communities most affected by the  War of  [[1812]],
   awareness was not particularly high. As the report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives revealed,
   "even in areas where the war was fought—specifically  [[Ontario]]'s Niagara Region—awareness
   remained foggy. In St Catharines, which is geographically close to where some significant

choices to be medicare and the Charter."11 It had to be difficult to identify the
 War of  [[1812]] as one of Canada's enduring symbols when the vast majority of
 [[Canadian]]s were unaware of the war or why it might be important, both before
and throughout the bicentennial celebrations.
The choice of the  War of  [[1812]] as the historical milestone around which the
Harper  [[government]] organized a series of events, activities, and testimonials, there
fore, cannot be separated from its political agenda and its understanding of the
world into which Canada's foreign policy is projected. Neither medicare (the result
of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)/New Democratic Party (NDP)
policies) nor the Charter (brought into being by the federal Liberal Party) would
respond to the exigencies of Conservative Party politics. The advantage of the  War
of  [[1812]] as part of a new national narrative was that not only would it allow the
 [[government]] to begin to recast the place of the war (and of war more generally) in
 [[Canadian]] popular  [[history]], it would do so in and against a particular context—that
of  [[Canadian]] internationalism—long identified with the Liberal Party of Canada.
As Kim Richard Nossal has argued, the overarching foreign policy orientation of
the Harper  [[government]] has been the belief in a Manichaean view of world politics,
wherein the international scene is dominated by "a struggle between good and
bad," and in such a black and  white world, "the real defining moments for the
country and for the world are those big conflicts where everything's at stake and
where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side."12 In addition,
however, as Nossal has detailed, for the Harper  [[government]], "the primary purpose
of international policy is to advance a domestic partisan agenda."13 To state it
more bluntly, foreign policy is also an instrument (among many others) that can be
deployed to assure the destruction of the Liberal Party as the "natural governing
party" of Canada, and its replacement in that role by the Conservative Party. The
celebration of the  War of  [[1812]] is consistent with these objectives not only because it
casts Canada as a country "born out of conflict"14 that chose to fight for the
"right" side and the "right" cause, but also because it creates the space in which
it becomes possible to respond to and begin to reframe the identity markers fur
nished for decades by the internationalism of Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson,
and the Liberal Party of Canada.
If the framing of the  War of  [[1812]] was done in response to the tenets of liberal
(and Liberal) internationalism, it is useful to return briefly to the meanings
associated with it. While internationalism has been understood as a series of
foreign policy practices (support for international institutions, multilateral pro
cesses, and international law) giving middle power countries the potential to
in [[flu]]ence great powers within multilateral structures, internationalism has

also "promoted a sense of  [[Canadian]] identity at the national and inter
national levels."15 In this sense, the study of  [[Canadian]] foreign policy is not
only about the policy practices of the  [[Canadian]]  [[government]]; it also asks ques
tions about how these practices contribute to defining the nature of Canada. In
its promotion of  [[Canadian]] identity, two elements of liberal internationalism
stand out as critical: first, internationalism implies a conviction about the
higher calling to which  [[Canadian]]s are held; its "purpose," in that sense, is to
provide a unifying common understanding of the virtues of Canada as an inter
national "brand" despite the complexities of  [[Canadian]] diversity. As such, the
moral content of  [[Canadian]] foreign policy (helpful fixer, good international citi
zen, peacekeeper, protector of the weak) is a powerful contributor to national
unity; if selflessness and altruism define who and what Canada is on the inter
national scene, they also affirm who and what  [[Canadian]]s are at home. Second,
and directly related to the first, the moral content of liberal internationalism
projects a  [[Canadian]] identity distinct from that of its southern neighbour, defining
a set of ways for  [[Canadian]]s to assert (and to confirm) their distinctiveness from
the  [[United States]].
The  War of  [[1812]] as a new discursive frame
The celebration of the bicentennial of the  War of  [[1812]] reframes  [[Canadian]] identity
in ways different from the frame provided by liberal (and Liberal) internationalism.
Despite its differences, however, the  [[1812]] reframing of the "true" nature of
 [[Canadian]] identity continues to respond to the two imperatives of the internation
alist discourse outlined above: the construction of a unifying pan- [[Canadian]] iden
tity that also asserts Canada's distinctiveness from the  [[United States]].
Liberal internationalism as a discursive project is intimately linked to Canada's
role in the resolution of the Suez Crisis and the awarding of Lester B. Pearson's
Nobel Peace Prize. The recasting of Canada from a peacekeeping nation to one
"born out of conflict" is, in the Harper  [[government]]'s framing, also tied to one
event: this time, the  War of  [[1812]]. It is worthy of note that by articulating the  War
of  [[1812]] as a national project before there was a nation, the Harper  [[government]] is at
least implicitly suggesting that a peace prize awarded in the  [[1950]]s constitutes an
aberration in the definition of Canada's "authentic" national identity. It is not
Nobel Peace Prizes that "define who we are as  [[Canadian]]s," but rather the "vet
erans who defended our land and ultimately won the fight for Canada."16 In this,
the  [[government]] of Canada is (arguably more subtly) reflecting the views of one of
the most ardent defenders of Canada's militaristic past, Jack Granatstein. In focus
ing on the  War of  [[1812]], the Harper  [[government]] is merely "highlighting something

everyone should know about anyway. There is a military past in Canada, and it
should be noted—not... hidden behind soft 'pacifist' views that have been perpe
tuated by popular social  [[history]] of the last 40 years."17 From this perspective, the
legacy of the Pearson Nobel Peace Prize is to be found in the soft pacifist views that
deny Canada's true military identity—and the "truth" of that identity is enshrined
in the date of its birth:  [[1812]] rather than  [[1956]].
 [[1812]] as a unifying moment
The recasting of Canada as a military or warrior nation (rather than as a peace
keeping one) does not merely rest on the ability of the  [[government]] to reach further
back into  [[history]] than the peacekeeping narrative is able to go.18 Considerable
efforts are deployed to create a discourse that unifies rather than divides
 [[Canadian]]s. Of particular note, the representations of the  War of  [[1812]] emphasize
the participation of Canada's  [[First Nations]], as well as of francophone  [[Canadian]]
soldiers, in the effort to vanquish the enemy. The war's commemorative symbols
focus on this tripartite " [[Canadian]]"  [[alliance]]. As an example, the special  [[silver]] dollar
coin produced by the  [[Canadian]] Mint (selling for almost $60) depicts "a  [[British]]
sergeant, a Voltigeur Canadien and an Iroquois warrior wearing historically accur
ate uniforms, approaching the invader with unity of purpose to defend the border
and colonies they represent."19 The "major figures" deemed central to the war
effort similarly highlight the contributions of  [[Canadian]]s of anglophone, franco
phone, and  [[First Nations]] backgrounds.20 As the Government of Canada's  War of
 [[1812]] website reminds us, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, the "Hero of Upper
Canada," was a member of the  [[British]] Army. With the arrival of war in  [[1812]],
he initiated an aggressive campaign to protect Upper Canada, even though his
superiors had advised him to remain on the defensive. Tecumseh, a Shawnee
chief and leader of a large tribal confederacy that opposed  [[American]] territorial
expansion, joined Brock in the  [[battle]] to capture Detroit on 16  [[August]]  [[1812]]. For his
part, Charles de Salaberry served as an officer of the  [[British]] Army in Lower
Canada (now  [[Quebec]]). As war loomed in the spring of  [[1812]], he helped raise a
unit of militia corps, known as the  [[Canadian]] Voltigeurs, from among his primarily

The  [[government]] of Canada is not content to reach back to  [[1812]] to confirm Canada's militaristic
roots. Extensive celebrations are planned for  [[2017]] in remembrance of the  [[1917]] Battle of Vimy
Ridge and the sacrifice of thousands of  [[Canadian]] soldiers. As a precursor to these celebrations, the
new polymer $20 bill features the  [[Canadian]] National Vimy Memorial located in northern  [[France]],
rather than the artwork by  [[First Nations]] artist Bill Reid, notably his sculptures Raven and the First
Men and Spirit of Haida Gwaii, as was the case with the "old" $20 bill.

 [[French]]  [[Canadian]] compatriots. He is best known for the Battle of Châteauguay in
 [[October]] of  [[1813]], where about 1,700  [[Canadian]]s helped repel around 3,
 [[American]] troops and Montreal was saved from a large-scale attack.21 Not only
do these figures grace the website, they are also pictured and their contributions
described at each of the national  [[1812]] war memorials.
Care given to highlighting the contributions of Canada's three founding peoples
is not limited to the identification of major figures in the  War of  [[1812]]. Prime
Minister Harper has been systematic in underscoring the role of diverse
 [[Canadian]]s in the prosecution of the war. For example, in a speech given in the
 [[Quebec]] community of Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix in  [[September]]  [[2012]], Harper
emphasized the importance of the contributions of francophone  [[Canadian]]s to
the war effort: "One of those men was Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry. He bril
liantly led his troops, the Voltigeurs canadiens, at the Battle of Châteauguay. His
heroic victory made it possible to protect Montreal. His achievements made him
one of our most esteemed military leaders."22 In a ceremony held at Rideau Hall to
honour the contributions of  [[Aboriginal]] peoples in the  War of  [[1812]], Harper con
tinued in this vein, this time highlighting the role of Canada's  [[First Nations]]:
"During the  War of  [[1812]],  [[First Nations]] and Métis warriors stood shoulder
to-shoulder with English and  [[French]]-speaking militias and  [[British]] military forces
to defend our country against  [[American]] invaders... Without their courage and
honour, Canada would not have been able to successfully defend itself and we
would not have the peaceful and prosperous country our citizens enjoy today."
The true point of Harper's testimonials became clear later in his speech honouring
De Salaberry and providing retroactive theatre distinctions ("Defence of
Canada— [[1812]] to  [[1815]]") to six  [[Canadian]] regiments whose precursors participated
in the  War of  [[1812]]:
The regiments honoured include of course the Royal 22e and the Voltigeurs de
 [[Québec]].
The 22e Régiment in particular is well known for its important role in both world  [[wars]]
and more recently in Afghanistan.
But its origins date back in fact to the fight for Canada in  [[1812]], in particular the
 [[battle]]s in the Châteauguay region under De Salaberry.
And the famous Citadelle of  [[Québec]] was built in response to that war.

It is another example of the in [[flu]]ence that the  War of  [[1812]] has had up to this very day
both on our  [[history]] as a country and on our cultural heritage.
Friends, what makes this war so important is that  [[French]]  [[Canadian]]s, English,
 [[Aboriginal]] peoples and many others, like freed  [[slaves]], took up arms together to
achieve a common objective, to resist the  [[American]] invasion.
And the ties our ancestors forged laid the foundations of a truly pan- [[Canadian]] iden
tity and made our Confederation possible, a country of great cultural diversity with
two national languages.
Let us always remember that this country, Canada, exists only because of diverse
peoples, English-speaking,  [[French]]-speaking,  [[Aboriginal]], and others, who came
together in  [[1812]] to resist the  [[American]] invasion and to defend their unique identities
and our shared territory.
The  War of  [[1812]] assumes an almost mythical status in this retelling, for it becomes
a moment in which a "true"  [[Canadian]] national identity is forged. In contrast to
 [[Canadian]] internationalism, where a pan- [[Canadian]] identity is constructed through
an attachment to specific political values (however exaggerated), this new  [[Canadian]]
identity is born of political necessity. Canada's identity stems from the commitment
of its peoples—especially English,  [[French]], and  [[First Nations]]—to defending
Canada from  [[American]] invasion. Canada, as the former minister of national
defence Peter MacKay would have it, was thus "born out of conflict" rather
than out of legislative gradualism. In this narrative, Canada was forged in the
crucible of war, in which all of its founding peoples played a key role. Of course,
these claims of collaboration between all of Canada's peoples gloss over how many
residents of what would become  [[Ontario]] would have been happier fighting for the
 [[American]]s (and providing them aid and comfort when they could). Similarly, in the
 [[United States]], there were clear divisions between Republicans and Federalists over
the wisdom of the war. Historian Alan Taylor's much-respected  [[2010]] book, The
Civil  War of  [[1812]], suggests the extent to which representations of the war as a
 [[battle]] between two nations is overstated to the point of misrepresentation.
More importantly, the  [[1812]] portrait of a unified Canada is not developed
around the values of peacekeeping or good international citizenship; it is not
Canada—the honest broker. It is Canada the warrior nation, with all of its peoples
participating in that warrior inclination. Individual differences between  [[Canadian]]s
based on their language or ethnic group are largely irrelevant in this warrior nation.
[[Prime Minister]] Stephen Harper, "PM delivers remarks in Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix,  [[Quebec]]."
    Of course, the defence of Canada theatre distinctions were being awarded for  [[battle]]s waged at a
    time when Canada did not exist and therefore cannot be said to have been defended, at least not as
    properly understood.

For Harper, this point is particularly clear, as he revealed in his Canada Day  [[2012]]
speech:
Almost exactly two centuries ago, an  [[American]] invasion of Canada was launched.
Our ancestors, English,  [[French]],  [[Aboriginal]], people of all backgrounds, joined in the
fight for Canada.
It was during the  War of  [[1812]]—the  [[battle]] for Canada—that the very foundations of
this great country of ours were laid.
A country born in  [[French]], a country proud of its cultural diversity, stability and
prosperity, a country, Canada, that stands apart in  [[North]] America.
In fighting together, our ancestors in  [[1812]] laid the basis for a common sense of
 [[Canadian]] nationality based on diversity.
And they laid the basis for the vision of freedom, democracy and justice that is our
inheritance, Canada, the best country in the world.
The  War of  [[1812]] gives birth to a common sense of  [[Canadian]] nationality based on
diversity. Difference is not itself important, although what differences exist—within
Canada and between Canada and the  [[United States]]—were the results of the  War of
 [[1812]]: "Without the  War of  [[1812]], the  [[French]] fact in  [[North]] America would not be
protected here in Canada. Without the  War of  [[1812]], the  [[Aboriginal]] fact would not
be protected. Without the  War of  [[1812]], Canada would not have been established in
 [[1867]]."27  [[Canadian]] identity is thus entrenched (and defined) in a particular under
standing of the source of the  [[Canadian]] values that Harper outlines. His under
standing of the source of these values is made clear in a speech given at the Chief of
Defence Staff Change of Command ceremony on 29  [[October]]  [[2012]]. While one
might expect that the speech would herald the many contributions of General
Natynchzyk during his four years as chief of the defence staff, it in fact begins
by painting a picture of Canada that finds its origins in the  War of  [[1812]]. Speaking
about the  [[Canadian]] military as an institution, Harper points out that:
Two hundred years ago this year, the first roots of this institution took hold when
 [[Canadian]]s of diverse backgrounds risked, and in many cases, lost their lives in the war
that firmly established our existence as a separate country.

Turenne Sjolander 16!
And in every generation since the  War of  [[1812]], a special group of citizens, men and
women, have put on the uniform and put themselves in harm's way, so that their
fellow  [[Canadian]]s need not.
It is the institution of the military, the institution through which different
 [[Canadian]]s in all their diversity have participated, and the war waged by the mili
tary, which has constructed the nation. As the prime minister reminds us on the
 [[1812]] website, "[t]he  War was instrumental in creating Canada's armed forces.
Many of our current reserve regiments in  [[Ontario]],  [[Quebec]], and  [[Atlantic]] Canada
trace their origins back to this time. It was the beginning of a long and proud
military  [[history]] in Canada."29 We are not peacekeepers, we are warriors. This is
not the Canada of the Nobel Peace Prize, this is the Canada of bumper stickers
reading " War of  [[1812]]: Been There, Won That."
The unifying nature of this new narrative of  [[Canadian]] identity is thus a function
of "everyone" having participated in the war. The loyalty to a coherent and unified
Canada despite our diversity stems from the loyalty owed to those who ostensibly
fought to protect it between  [[1812]] and  [[1815]]. Just as the  [[death]]s of  [[Canadian]] soldiers
in Afghanistan were often mobilized to legitimize Canada's continued participation
in the war (to withdraw would have betrayed their sacrifice), so too, the fact that
"Canada's diverse peoples" repulsed the  [[American]] invasion, with many dying in
the effort, is more than enough to construct a unified Canada two hundred years
later. As Minister Moore has been fond of saying, it is "[t]hese heroic efforts" that
"tell the story of today's Canada."
 [[1812]] and the birth of a distinct Canada
If the  War of  [[1812]] constructs Canada as unified by the very fact of  [[Canadian]]
participation in the war, how does the  [[1812]] narrative construct Canada as distinct,
notably from the  [[United States]]? At first, the answer seems self-evident.  [[Canadian]]s
are not  [[American]]s because  [[Canadian]]s "won" the  War of  [[1812]]. The war defined, in
Stephen Harper's words, "what side of the border we live on, and which flag we
salute." Canada stood up to the  [[American]] invasion. As Minister Moore put it in
 [[June]]  [[2012]], "As  [[Canadian]]s, we are used to thinking of our neighbours to the south
as friends and allies. But, 200 years ago,  [[American]] troops stormed our borders.

Thomas Jefferson said the  [[American]] invasion would be 'a mere matter of
marching'... The  War of  [[1812]] was the fight for Canada."32 The pride at having
proven Jefferson wrong (and the pleasure of quoting his erroneous assessment
some 200 years later) is evident. Whereas the narrative of internationalism con
structed Canada's distinctiveness on the basis of its "middle power" values, the
 [[1812]] narrative posits that Canada's distinctiveness rests on having defeated the
 [[United States]] in the "fight for Canada": "The  War of  [[1812]]... defined our terri
torial integrity, defined us differently from the  [[United States]] and was instrumental
in the creation of our country,"33 Moore explains. The  [[1812]] narrative constructs a
unified Canada because all of Canada's diverse people fought in the war, and a
distinct Canada because "we won." The space for political discussion around
values is limited, because the  War of  [[1812]] establishes the facts.
The Harper  [[government]] does not rest here in deploying the  [[1812]] narrative. The
war is also constructed as the catalyst for peace. In the words of the prime minister
himself, "The signing of the  [[Treaty]] of Ghent and other  [[treaties]] that followed
confirmed the border between Canada and the  [[United States]]—now the world's
longest, undefended border and an example of nations coexisting peacefully side by
side with mutual respect and friendship."34  War is an instrument that brings sus
tainable peace, and the implication is clear. Without the  War of  [[1812]], Canada's
relations with the  [[United States]] might well be fraught with tensions and challenges.
The  War of  [[1812]] resolved all of that.
Finally, Canada is also distinct from the  [[United States]] because Canada is
 [[British]]. The Canada of today, born of the  War of  [[1812]], is "an independent and
free country in a constitutional monarchy with its own  [[parliament]]ary system."35 The
attachment to the  [[Crown]], while subtle, marks the  [[1812]] narrative and the symbols
supporting it. Graphical representations of the major figures of the war reproduce
their  [[British]] military uniforms. The Union Jack is foregrounded, always flying
high. When  [[Prime Minister]] Harper met with  [[First Nations]] leaders at Rideau
Hall to thank them for their contributions to the  War of  [[1812]], the  [[Crown]] was
omnipresent in his remarks:
All those years ago at the conclusion of the  War of  [[1812]], and in recognition of their
valour,  [[Aboriginal]] communities were presented with military banners and  [[King]]
George the Third medals. So it will be today.

 [[1812]] Commemorative Medals. Both Banner and Medal reflect the strong connection
of Canada's  [[First Nations]] to the  [[Crown]].
The medal design has a likeness of Her Majesty The  [[Queen]] on one side, and the image
from the commemorative banner on the reverse. Usage of the  [[Queen]]'s likeness and the
design of the medal itself were approved by Buckingham Palace. They are bestowed
today as symbols of an unbreakable bond forged in a common struggle.
There is an attachment to a notion of benevolent queen and country which tra
verses Harper's  [[1812]] speeches, nowhere more clearly than in his assertion that "the
 War helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country,
united under the  [[Crown]] with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity."37 The
continued diversity of  [[Canadian]]s, made possible by the outcome of the  War of
 [[1812]], is a diversity that is articulated within a specific— [[British]]—context. If the
narrative of internationalism—of a compassionate Canada engaged with the
world—was mirrored domestically by the ethos of  [[multiculturalism]], the narrative
of  [[1812]] has no such pretenses. Multiculturalism is replaced by an explicit attach
ment to the  [[British]]  [[Crown]]. Adding the prefix "Royal" to the  [[Canadian]] Navy and
Air Force, as Harper did in  [[2011]], is only one manifestation of this narrative.38 The
 [[Canadian]] military, which forged the nation, is a Royal one.
Conclusion: The  [[battle]] of the narratives
If the narrative of  [[1812]] has tried to recast  [[Canadian]] unity and distinctiveness along
new lines, we must ask about the impacts of such a discursive manoeuvre.39 As I
 [[National Post]] Staff, "'Key to the victory': Stephen Harper honours  [[First Nations]] contribution to
the  War of  [[1812]],"  [[National Post]], 25  [[October]]  [[2012]], http://news.nationalpost.com/ [[2012]]/10/25/key
to-the-victory-stephen-harper-honours-first-nations-contribution-to-war-of- [[1812]]/ (accessed 3
 [[April]]  [[2013]]). Nowhere in his speech does Harper allude to the very complicated, and often con
frontational, relationship between  [[First Nations]] peoples and the  [[Crown]]. For  [[First Nations]] peoples
throughout  [[North]] America, the  War of  [[1812]] was far more a "desperate struggle for freedom and
independence" and a fight "to defend their homelands" than a question of choosing sides—and
certainly not of lining up with the  [[British]] to defend Canada from  [[American]] invasion. See "Four
 Wars of  [[1812]]," Military History  [[Research]] Centre,  [[Canadian]]  War Museum, http://
http://www.warmuseum.ca/military- [[history]]- [[research]]-centre/publications/four- [[wars]]-of- [[1812]]/ (accessed

It is important to note that the campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the  War of  [[1812]] was
almost certainly not successful in teaching  [[Canadian]]s about the war or its importance. As the
report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives (cited at the outset of this article) discussed, even during
the height of the  [[1812]] celebrations, "the relevance of commemorating the event seemed lost on
almost all" ( [[Canadian]] Press, "Few  [[Canadian]]s aware"). Nonetheless, the extent to which
 [[Canadian]]s learned, or indeed, cared, about the  War of  [[1812]], despite the expenditures of millions
of dollars, is in some respect beside the point. The messages about Canada that the Harper gov
ernment associated with the celebration of the  War of  [[1812]]—messages that appear in other cam
paigns in other contexts—transcend the specifics of this one effort at commemoration.

have argued elsewhere, understood as part of the process of constructing and
reinforcing a specific  [[Canadian]] identity, the use of the internationalist narrative
has not been without its consequences.40 If Canada is unusually virtuous and moral
on the world stage, this necessarily implies that others are not quite as virtuous or
possessing of the same moral superiority. A claim of being a uniquely virtuous or
moral nation both casts  [[Canadian]] domestic politics as uniquely harmonious and
egalitarian (for such a virtuous moral posture internationally surely must be the
result of a uniquely moral society domestically) and projects an imperial project
abroad: in constructing Canada as noble, virtuous, and laudable, foreign "others"
are necessarily constructed as less noble and virtuous.
The  [[1812]] narrative also clearly seeks to project  [[Canadian]] authority internation
ally by casting Canada as a prudent but potentially belligerent country. As Harper
has made clear,  [[Canadian]] foreign policy would not reflect the "soft pacifist" views
associated by Conservative supporters with Liberal internationalism. No longer
would the purpose of Canada's foreign policy be "just to go along and get along
with everyone else's agenda. It is no longer to please every dictator with a vote at
the United Nations."41 Far from the helpful fixer posture associated with peace
keeping, Canada would not seek to mediate a resolution to conflicts, but would
rather choose sides wisely and be prepared to fight.
The  [[1812]] narrative also acts to cast Canada's domestic sphere in a more com
bative light. The  War of  [[1812]] defines Canada in the context of a political project,
but one that is exclusionary as much as it is inclusionary (both rhetorically and in
practice)—for it is the project of Empire. While Harper's speeches remind us of the
participation of the  [[French]] and the  [[First Nations]] in prosecuting the  War of  [[1812]],
they are integrated as subjects of the  [[Crown]], rather than as actors in their own
right, with their own claims against the  [[American]]s. While the rhetoric of inter
nationalism conceals an imperialism which is outwardly directed (if  [[Canadian]]s are
morally superior, that moral superiority is exercised with respect to someone), the
new rhetoric of  [[1812]] constructs an imperialism which is both powerfully internal
(one nation under the  [[British]]  [[Crown]]) and external ( [[Canadian]]s are right to fight
 [[wars]] because Canada was "born out of conflict" and Canada's glory was and is
proven through war).
This new rhetoric is also powerfully gendered, because war—and certainly the
 War of  [[1812]]—is man's work. The willingness to fight, to prove oneself superior to
the  [[American]] invaders, the glory of the ultimate sacrifice—the ideal  [[Canadian]] in
the service of the nation—is constructed along a model of militarized masculinity.
Women are nearly invisible in this new narrative, despite the efforts of the Harper
 [[government]] to appear inclusive. That effort is focused first on the figure of Laura
Secord, who fulfils the role in the  [[1812]] narrative of "standing in" for all women

and of allowing the Harper  [[government]] to claim that the  [[1812]] discourse is inclusive
of everyone. The "official" story of Laura Secord is worthy of a close look:
Laura Secord's adventures started when her husband, James Secord, a sergeant in the
1st Lincoln militia, was wounded early on in the  War of  [[1812]]. She managed to rescue
him from the  [[battle]]field during the  [[battle]] of  [[Queen]]ston Heights...
In  [[June]] of  [[1813]],  [[Queen]]ston was still occupied by  [[American]] troops when James and
Laura Secord were forced to host some  [[American]] officers in their home. That's when
she overheard the  [[American]]s plan to surprise the  [[British]] outpost at Beaver Dams and
capture the officer in charge, Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. Her husband, given his
injuries, was unable to deliver this message to the  [[British]] so she set out to do it herself.
The direct route to the outpost was 12 miles (about 20 kilometres), and Laura was
worried that she would encounter  [[American]] guards on her way there. She decided it
would be better to travel through fields and forests; it wasn't easy and when she finally
arrived, she was exhausted.
After she crossed the Twelve Mile  [[Cree]]k on a fallen tree, Laura was surprised to come
upon a  [[First Nations]]' encampment. Once her mission was explained, the chief took
her directly to FitzGibbon. Two days later,  [[American]] troops were ambushed near
Beaver Dams by  [[First Nations]] warriors. FitzGibbon then persuaded the much larger
 [[American]] forces to surrender.
In this  War of  [[1812]] biography, Laura Secord is the perfect—and per
fectly—militarized wife. She is an admirable helpmate to her soldier husband,
arguably going beyond the call of duty in rescuing him from the  [[battle]]field. She
cares for him and tends to his injuries. Once she overhears the plans of the
 [[American]] soldiers, she decides she must warn the  [[British]], but only because her
husband cannot do so as a result of his wounds. She is the Rosie the Riveter of the
 War of  [[1812]]—assuming a temporary duty because her husband cannot. The hier
archy of love—for god, country, and home—is revealed, as she sets out on a dan
gerous mission because loyalty to the ( [[British]]) state is a higher calling, more
important that her own safety or that of her wounded husband.
Laura Secord is one of only two women given preeminence in the  [[1812]] narrative,
although the one woman deemed to be a major figure. The second woman featured
in the Harper  [[government]]'s recounting of the war is Mary Henry, and her role is
even more characteristic of the gendered hierarchies necessary to construct militar
ized masculinity. During a particularly fierce  [[battle]] in  [[May]]  [[1813]], a large  [[American]]
army made an amphibious assault on Niagara, landing not far from the lighthouse

This story of Laura Secord completely erases her activist campaign after her husband's  [[death]] to be
    awarded a widow's pension, something which did not exist at the time. See Peggy Dymond Leavy,
    Laura Secord: The Heroine of the  War of  [[1812]] ( [[Toronto]]: Dundurn Press,  [[2012]]).

where Henry's husband, a retired artillery gunner, was the keeper. Throughout the
landing and the extremely heavy  [[bomb]]ardment, casualties were numerous with half
the  [[British]] and  [[Canadian]]s  [[kill]]ed or wounded. During this entire action, Mary
Henry walked the  [[battle]]field, bringing coffee and food to the troops and tending
to the wounded, as though "guarded by some unseen angel from the peril which
menaced her every step."44 Mary Henry is the ultimate nurse, bringing food and
comfort to the troops. Her role, while celebrated, is supportive—of the men in
 [[battle]], and of the state which wages war. Neither Mary Henry nor Laura Secord
raise questions about state policy nor do they advocate solutions other than war.
The near invisibility of women, their silent support for a nation at war, their
selfless support of the men (and the state) that prosecute the war—these gender
roles are replicated in the controversy surrounding the unveiling of the design
finalists for the  War of  [[1812]] memorial which will find pride of place as a permanent
fixture on Parliament Hill. The terms of reference for the design of the memorial
required that the proposals represent seven distinct groups: the  [[British]] Army, the
 [[British]] Navy, the Provincial Marine, the English-speaking militia, the  [[French]]
speaking militia,  [[First Nations]], and Métis.45 Of the two shortlisted statues, only
one displays a woman—caring for a wounded soldier in the background.46 If war
confirms the glory of the nation, women are not central to that project. The nar
rative of  [[1812]] confirms that foreign policy is man's work.
Whereas the rhetoric of internationalism depoliticizes Canada's  [[wars]] (by con
structing them as peacekeeping or the work of the good international citizen—and
therefore always right), the rhetoric of  [[1812]] gives pride of place to Canada's mili
tary and a particular Manichaean understanding of world politics. This under
standing tries to reframe the way in which two basic elements of the
internationalist discourse functions:  [[Canadian]]s are unified (because we participated
in our diversity in the war under the  [[British]]  [[Crown]], which is our real heritage) and
we are distinct from the  [[United States]] (because we won, and because we are
 [[British]]). Declaring the military to be a "Royal" institution and ordering
 [[Canadian]] embassies, high commissions, and consulates abroad to display pictures
of the  [[Queen]]47 reaffirm this understanding of the world and Canada's place within

the Empire. It also frames "appropriate" gender and ethnic roles and responsibil

see the  War of  [[1812]] through Stephen Harper's looking glass.
