The Significance of Article 37
Kirsty Gover
Drawing largely on jurisprudence and legislation in Canada,  [[Australia]]  and  [[New Zealand]] ,
this paper argues that article 37 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)^1 is an important provision that is underutilized in efforts
to implement the declaration in domestic law. Article 37 states:
Indigenous peoples have the right to the recognition,
   observance and enforcement of  [[treaties]] , agreements and other
   constructive arrangements concluded with States or their successors
   and to have States honour and respect such  [[treaties]] , agreements and
   other constructive arrangements.
Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as diminishing
   or eliminating the rights of  [[indigenous]]  peoples contained in  [[treaties]] ,
   agreements and other constructive arrangements.
By declaring that  [[treaty]]  guarantees are not to be diminished by other provisions in
UNDRIP, article 37 appropriately exemplifies the kind of priority that historical collective
Indigenous rights must have if they are to be adequately protected from the competing

claims of third parties. If used in advocacy and negotiation, it could assist in making clear that the
contents of Indigenous-state agreements protected by UNDRIP should not be “read down” or made
subject to the qualifications set out in article 46 of UNDRIP. In domestic law, the article could assist in
efforts to protect  [[treaty]]  rights from qualifications that might otherwise be brought to bear on them,
including limitations permitted in legislative or constitutional bills of rights.
I take as a starting point the idea that  [[treaties]]  provide a way for Indigenous peoples and states to
“contract out” of general public law, in order to emphasize the distinctive historical relationship
that pertains between settler  [[government]] s and Indigenous nations. Article 37 conveys the correct
(in my view) understanding of appropriately concluded  [[treaties]]  as quasi-contractual constitutional
agreements that are not subject to general norms of distributive justice, individual rights and non-
discrimination principles. This idea could be pursued in practice by including article 37 in  [[treaties]]  and
agreements, even as preambular passages, and — so far as possible — in the legislative and regulatory
mechanisms that enable and facilitate agreement making and provide the mandate of negotiators. It
could also be referred to by Indigenous nations in agreement-making processes and advocacy, and in
arguments used in negotiation and litigation.
The current  [[treaty]] -making processes that have been initiated in the  [[Australia]] n states of Victoria and
 [[Queen]] sland and in the  [[North]] ern  Territory provide an opportunity to draw on article 37 as support
for Indigenous priorities in  [[treaty]]  making. It could also assist with the efforts of  [[First Nations]]  in
Canada to ensure that  [[treaty]]  rights, protected by section 35 of the  [[Canadian]]  Constitution, are not read
down by reference to the individual rights protected in the  [[Canadian]]  Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(including the Charter’s non-discrimination provisions). It provides support for a narrower reading of
the permissible legislative limitations on  [[treaty]]  rights than is evident in jurisprudence on section 35,
including by supporting a reading of section 25 of the Constitution as a “shield” to protect  [[treaty]]  and
 [[Aboriginal]]  title rights from limitations imposed in the service of competing Charter rights. In New
Zealand, reference to article 37 could assist to reinforce the priority of  [[treaty]]  rights over public and
third party interests in claims settlement processes, litigation and in constitutional debates on the
meaning and status of the  [[treaty]] . It could also assist in arguments intended to protect the  [[treaty]]  and its
guarantees from competing third party rights asserted under the  [[New Zealand]]  Bill of Rights Act  [[1990]]
(NZBORA). To date, however, in the few instances in which UNDRIP is referred to in the domestic law
and policy in these countries, article 37 has received little emphasis.
Drafting History of Article 37
Article 37, and its predecessor, draft article 36, were relatively uncontroversial during the Working Group
on the Draft Declaration (WGDD) negotiations, the Human Rights Council vote in  [[2006]]  and the  [[2007]]
United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adoption vote. None of the CANZUS states (Canada,  [[Australia]] ,
 [[New Zealand]]  and the  [[United States]] ) referred to article 37 as a reason for their negative votes in  [[2007]] , and
only one state, Nigeria, referred to article 37 to explain its abstention.^2 The article was cited, however,
in the  [[Africa]] n Group’s aide-memoire , a document setting out the group’s concerns with the  [[2006]]  text of
the declaration. The relevant section of the aide-memoire explains that “[t]he  [[Africa]] n Group has serious
reservations regarding the implications of this Article,” but does not elaborate on the detail of those
concerns.^3
2 UNGAOR, 61st Sess, 108th Plen Mtg, UN Doc A/61/PV.108 ( [[2007]] ) (Mr. Akindele [Nigeria]: ‘‘However, my delegation wishes to stress that a number
of concerns critical to the interests of my country were not satisfactorily addressed. Some of those concerns include the issue of territorial integrity, self-
determination — articles 3 and 4 — the control of lands, territories and resources — article 26 — and article 37, which deals with the important issue of
 [[treaties]] ” at 6).

The article was among those on which a “provisional agreement” was reached during consultation
exercises in the penultimate and final sessions of the WGDD in  [[2005]]  and  [[2006]] . The working group chair
presiding in these sessions recalls that article 37 was among the least controversial provisions of the
declaration: “The other outstanding articles presented no great difficulties and the alter[[native]]s retained
were those which, in the light of the opinions expressed in the consultations, had the greatest possibility
of obtaining a consensus, as in the case of Article 36 (Article 37 of the Declaration as adopted by the UNGA)
on  [[treaties]] , in which the proposal presented by the facilitators was maintained.”^4
The original ( [[1994]] ) draft text of article 37 (draft article 36) was therefore amended in the  [[2006]]  “compromise
text”^5 that was prepared by the working group chair in accordance with the proposals put to him in his
consultations before and during the final session of the WGDD. The original formulation of draft article
36 was as follows: “Indigenous peoples have the right to the recognition, observance and enforcement
of  [[treaties]] , agreements and other constructive arrangements concluded with States or their successors,
according to their original spirit and intent , and to have States honour and respect such  [[treaties]] , agreements
and other constructive arrangements. Conflicts and disputes which cannot otherwise be settled should be
submitted to competent international bodies agreed to by all parties concerned .”^6
As the amended text suggests, states proposed the removal of the final clause of the draft article, which
contemplated the submission of  [[treaty]]  disputes to “competent international bodies.”^7 Proposals to amend
the draft article in this way were vehemently rejected by Indigenous peoples’ organizations represented
at the working group.^8 Even while states proposed wording to clarify and reduce the extent of their
obligations under article 37 (as they did with other provisions), the article is not among the group of
provisions that attracted the most vehement objections from CANZUS states (these being articles 26–
on land and compensation, articles 3 and 4 on self-determination, and articles 19 and 32 on consultation
and free, prior and informed consent).
This may be due, in part, to the fact that the crucially significant second sub-article, article 37(2), was
a late addition to the draft text, and was not debated by states in the WGDD plenary sessions of  [[1996]] –
It first appears in the chair’s summary of proposals at the conclusion of the tenth session of
      the working group in  [[2005]] ,^9 and was discussed in facilitated consultations at the eleventh (and final)
      session, although no consensus was then reached on the text.^10 Records show that article 37(2) derives
      from a “proposal by the Indigenous caucus at the Organization of  [[American]]  States (OAS),  [[November]]  11,
       [[2004]] ,”^11 referring to the fourth meeting of the Working Group to Prepare the Draft  [[American]]  Declaration

on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (ADRIP). It was proposed by the Indigenous Caucus in the OAS
forum as text for ADRIP, draft article XXIII.^12 Article 37(2) thus provides a good example of the power of
international Indigenous cooperation and collaboration across multiple negotiating fora.^13 Because of
its sub-article (2), article 37 is one of the only articles in the UNDRIP text that escapes the overarching
limiting effect of article 46, which is the omnibus limitation clause added (controversially) in  [[2007]]  to
secure the endorsement of states in the General Assembly.^14
Article 37 in Domestic Law and Policy
Article 37 has not, as yet, appeared in judicial references to UNDRIP in  [[Australia]] ,^15 Canada^16 or New
Zealand.^17 The potential significance of article 37’s second clause, however, can be illustrated by reference
to judicial observations made in a  [[New Zealand]]  case, Takamore v Clarke , involving the assertion by a
Māori whanau (family) of Māori customary law in a dispute concerning the burial of a deceased relative.^18
The case was eventually decided in the Supreme Court without substantive reference to UNDRIP,^19 but
in the Court of Appeal’s  [[2011]]  judgment, all three judges discussed the relevance of the declaration to the
case, observing that: “It is noteworthy that the [UNDRIP], to which  [[New Zealand]]  has subscribed, while
recognising the rights of  [[indigenous]]  peoples to develop and maintain ‘juridical systems or customs’ in
Article 34, also states in Article 46(2) that nothing in the exercise of the rights under the Declaration
undermines ‘fundamental freedoms.’”^20
As this quotation illustrates, it remains open to judges considering UNDRIP rights in domestic litigation to
qualify them at the outset by reference to article 46. Article 37(2) deflects this possibility where  [[treaty]]  rights
are at stake. In  [[New Zealand]] , this is especially important, since the  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi is not referenced in
the NZBORA and has not (to date) been made subject to limitations allowed by that instrument, including
individual rights and rights of non-discrimination. On one reading, then, reference to UNDRIP in the
Takamore Court of Appeal decision appears to enable the qualification of  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi rights in
a way that is not otherwise required in domestic law. In other words, if article 37, which requires that
 [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi rights not be qualified by other UNDRIP provisions, had been referred to by the court,
the limitations contained in article 46 may not have featured in the judges’ reasoning. In the  [[New Zealand]]
context at least, Māori rights to maintain their “juridical systems” are encompassed within the right to
tino rangatiratanga contained in the  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi. As rights enshrined in that  [[treaty]] , they receive the
extra protection afforded by UNDRIP article 37. In this case, it is at least arguable that the rights protected
by article 34, like other  [[treaty]]  rights, should not be read down by reference to article 46’s protection of
“fundamental freedoms.”

Treaties and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: The Significance of Article 37 • Kirsty Gover
81
As Megan Davis observes, article 37 is also of particular relevance to  [[treaty]]  debates in  [[Australia]] , even
though  [[Australia]]  has yet to conclude a  [[treaty]]  with any Indigenous peoples.^21 As plans for a state-level
 [[treaty]]  or  [[treaties]]  proceed in Victoria,  [[Queen]] sland and in the  [[North]] ern  Territory, new opportunities to
draw on article 37 will arise. UNDRIP is referenced in the preamble of Victoria’s  [[2018]]   [[Treaty]]  Advancement
legislation, which establishes the  [[Treaty]]  Advancement Commission, but express note is made only of
UNDRIP’s protection of “free, prior and informed consent.”^22 At the time of writing, the newly constituted
First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, tasked with negotiating a  [[treaty]]  framework with the Victorian state
to guide  [[treaty]]  making, had concluded its inaugural sitting. UNDRIP forms part of the mandate set out in
the assembly’s constitution as one of the principles underpinning its work.^23 Consideration could be given
to making reference to article 37 in the  [[treaty]]  framework, and in the texts of  [[treaties]]  and agreements
themselves. It is also possible, as Davis argues, to read article 37 as expressing a right to conclude  [[treaties]] ,
an interpretation that could be of considerable use in Indigenous advocacy in  [[Australia]] .^24
In a sense, the relationship between UNDRIP articles 37 and 46 reproduces some of the sequencing
issues that have animated  [[New Zealand]]  debates on the interpretation of the NZBORA (and, in  [[Australia]] ,
the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities  [[2006]] ^25 ). These are centrally concerned with
whether the interaction of rights protected in the same instrument should be evaluated before or after
those rights have been read down by other qualifying interpretative principles.^26 There is much more to
be said about this conundrum in proportionality reasoning than can be usefully considered in this paper.
Suffice to say that article 37 is unusual both within UNDRIP and in international and domestic human
rights law in its express reference to the non-applicability of proportionality tests. In this way, it seems to
exemplify the kind of insulation that is needed if historical collective Indigenous rights are to be given full
effect in the domestic law of settler states.
Seen in this way, the relationship between article 46 and article 37 goes to the very heart of major legal and
political challenges faced by liberal democratic settler states. The tension between historical-collective
Indigenous rights and individual human rights is a long-standing and difficult one. Some Indigenous
rights, of the kind typically protected by historical and contemporary  [[treaties]] , are not based on claims
to an equitable share of primary goods on terms equal to those of other individuals, but to particular
 [[property]]  and powers, those that were held by the predecessors of Indigenous communities and have
been or should have been inherited by their descendants. These rights are not necessarily, or as a matter
of principle, “capped” by measures of equality and non-discrimination in the way that individual human
rights are. This makes it difficult to shoehorn them into prospective liberal human rights frameworks. The
risk is that when Indigenous rights are placed in competition with individual rights, strict adherence to
ahistorical and monistic equality principles will result in their qualification or abrogation.
Treaties provide a way to protect historical rights to  [[property]]  and authority that is not subject to the
distributive regimes used in human rights instruments. They typically sit outside of individual human
rights frameworks and are not directly qualified by the rights of non-parties. Section 35 of the  [[Canadian]]

82
Constitution, which protects the  [[Aboriginal]]  rights and  [[treaty]]  rights of Indigenous  [[Canadian]] s, is an
example of this practice. It is insulated (to a contested degree) from Charter rights by section 25, which
provides that: “The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed so as to
abrogate or derogate from any  [[aboriginal]] ,  [[treaty]]  or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the  [[aboriginal]]
peoples of Canada.”^27
A state-Indigenous  [[treaty]]  is to be interpreted in  [[Canadian]]  law in accordance with its status as “an
exchange of solemn promises” that is “sacred,”^28 and in a manner “which maintains the integrity of the
 [[Crown]] ” and does not admit the “appearance of ‘sharp dealing.’”^29 Any ambiguities must be resolved in
favour of the  [[Aboriginal]]  parties to the  [[treaty]] , and any limitation that “restrict[s] the rights of  [[Indian]] s under
 [[treaties]]  must be narrowly construed.”^30  However,  [[treaty]]  rights, like  [[Aboriginal]]  rights, can be infringed by
“justified” legislation that meets the “valid legislative objective” test set out in cases such as Sparrow^31
and Badger.^32 In order to satisfy this test, the federal Parliament’s objective must be valid (in the sense of
serving a valid public interest)^33 and the act in question must be consistent with the honour of the  [[Crown]]
and the  [[Crown]] ’s special trust and fiduciary responsibilities to  [[Aboriginal]]  peoples.^34 Further, in order to
assess whether the infringement of  [[treaty]]  rights is valid, a court will consider whether the act effects as
little infringement as is necessary to achieve the valid objective, whether fair compensation is paid, and
whether consultation has taken place with the affected group.^35 As was explained in Badger , the “valid
legislative objective” test is directed to public interest concerns: “This standard of scrutiny requires that
the  [[Crown]]  demonstrate that the legislation in question advances important general public objectives in
such a manner that it ought to prevail.”^36  Against this backdrop of legal principles that are protective of
 [[treaties]] , the logic encompassed within article 37 can assist arguments that call for a narrow reading of
permissible infringements where  [[treaty]]  rights are at stake.
Despite the protective function of section 25, there is also some suggestion in  [[Canadian]]  law that rights
protected by section 35, such as  [[treaty]]  rights, should be “balanced” with the Charter rights of third parties.
In effect, such an analysis places  [[treaty]]  rights in direct competition with Charter rights, which include the
right to be free from discrimination. In Badger , for example, the majority cited with approval the approach
taken by Justice Robert Blair in R v Agawa. While Justice Blair noted that section 35 is not included in the
Charter and is not subject to section 1 of the Charter (which provides that limitations to Charter rights
must be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society),^37 he went on to say: “ [[Indian]]   [[treaty]]  rights
are like all other rights recognized by our legal system. The exercise of rights by an individual or group is
limited by the rights of others. Rights do not exist in a vacuum and the exercise of any right involves a
balancing with the interests and values involved in the rights of others. This is recognized in section 1 of
the  [[Canadian]]  Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides that limitation of Charter rights must be
justified as reasonable in a free and democratic society.”^38

Treaties and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: The Significance of Article 37 • Kirsty Gover
83
This statement overlooks a crucial difference between the infringement test articulated in Sparrow ,
which is attentive to matters of public interest, and the “ordinary” balancing or proportionality tests
used to resolve competition between individual rights (as typified by section 1). First, section 25 of the
Constitution is expressly designed to prevent section 35 rights from being abrogated by deference to
competing Charter rights. Second,  [[treaty]]  rights are qualitatively different from human rights. As the court
in Badger noted,  [[treaties]]  are “analogous to contracts,” and this respect should be understood to generally
exclude consideration of the interests of third parties in accordance with ordinary privity rules. Even if
such a principle could be said to correctly express the relationship between section 35 and the Charter,
 [[treaty]]  rights should not in any case be conflated with  [[Aboriginal]]  rights, even while both are protected
by section 35.  [[Treaty]]  rights need not, for example, satisfy the probative tests required to prove that an
 [[Aboriginal]]  community holds  [[Aboriginal]]  rights. Unlike  [[Aboriginal]]  rights,  [[treaty]]  rights need not be tied to
“a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the  [[aboriginal]]  group claiming the
right,” in accordance with the Van der Peet test.^39  [[Canadian]]  courts have acknowledged elsewhere that
 [[treaties]]  can protect rights more extensive than, and different in kind to, those recognized in domestic law
as  [[Aboriginal]]  rights (so long, it seems, as those rights are ones generally within the collective sovereign
and constitutional powers of the state parties).^40 As the Supreme Court held in Badger :
There is no doubt that  [[aboriginal]]  and  [[treaty]]  rights differ in both origin and structure.
 [[Aboriginal]]  rights flow from the customs and traditions of the [[native]] peoples....
 [[Treaty]]  rights, on the other hand, are those contained in official agreements between
the  [[Crown]]  and the [[native]] peoples. Treaties are analogous to contracts, albeit of a
very solemn and special, public nature. They create enforceable obligations based
on the mutual consent of the parties. It follows that the scope of  [[treaty]]  rights will
be determined by their wording, which must be interpreted in accordance with the
principles enunciated by this Court.^41
With this in mind, section 25 therefore seems (on its face) intended to play a role similar to that of
UNDRIP article 37(2), shielding  [[treaty]]  rights from limitations that might otherwise be imposed in
favour of third parties. This is important, because the meaning and effect of section 25 are contested in
 [[Canadian]]  law, and article 37 may yet find purchase in those debates as a way to bolster a reading that
assigns section 25 a strong protective function where  [[treaty]]  rights are in question. As was discussed
in R v Kapp, the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether (in the words of the majority judges)
section 25 provides “an absolute bar” to Charter-based claims against section 35 rights, or is instead
“an interpretive provision informing the construction of potentially conflicting Charter rights.”^42 This
indeterminacy suggests that UNDRIP article 37(2) could make a difference in debates about the relation
between  [[treaty]]  and Charter rights. In the minority judgment offered by Justice Michel Bastarache in
R v Kapp , the judge was of the view that section 25 should be read in its strongest, most protective light,
and would have dismissed the conflicting Charter claim in favour of full protection of the impugned
section 35 right.^43 This judgment, I suggest, proposes a reading consistent with UNDRIP article 37, and
importantly, as will be explained, this is an approach consistent with the federal  [[government]] ’s recent
legislative and policy undertakings.

UNDRIP Implementation: Comparative Approaches, Indigenous Voices from CANZUS
84
In mid- [[2019]] , the  [[Canadian]]  Parliament contemplated a private member’s bill that would have obligated
the  [[government]]  to take “all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with
the [UNDRIP],”^44 suggesting that new opportunities to assert article 37 are contemplated. The bill passed
the House of Commons, but failed to pass in the  [[Canadian]]  Senate and thus was not enacted.^45 On
 [[November]]  28,  [[2019]] ,  [[British]]  Columbia’s legislature enacted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples Act  [[2019]] .^46 The act requires the provincial  [[government]]  to take “all measures necessary”
to ensure the consistency of provincial law with UNDRIP, in consultation and cooperation with
Indigenous peoples.^47 The  [[British]]  Columbia  [[government]]  has also undertaken “to work with Indigenous
peoples to jointly design, construct and implement principled, pragmatic and organized approaches
informed by [UNDRIP].”^48 Of particular importance, the  [[British]]  Columbia  [[Treaty]]  Commission, the host
of Canada’s most comprehensive  [[treaty]] -making process, reports that it intends to implement UNDRIP
as part of final stage  [[treaty]]  negotiations.^49 In  [[December]]   [[2018]] , the  [[government]]  of  [[British]]  Columbia, the
federal  [[government]]  of Canada and the  [[First Nations]]  Summit^50 signed a Principals’ Accord in which
they recognize that “ [[treaties]]  are one of the principal mechanisms for implementing [UNDRIP],”^51 and
in  [[September]]   [[2019]] , they adopted a new negotiating policy in which  [[treaties]]  will “provide for the
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( [[2007]] ), including
rights to redress and ‘free, prior and informed consent.’”^52 The policy refers specifically to UNDRIP
in the policy’s commitments to self-determination,^53 redress^54 and title.^55 In  [[2018]] , the outgoing chief
 [[treaty]]  commissioner announced that “[t]he BC  [[treaty]]  negotiations process is the best mechanism to
implement [UNDRIP].”^56 Further, the  [[Treaty]]  Commission recently sought and published a legal opinion
on whether the  [[treaty]]  process is consistent with UNDRIP’s provisions on free, prior and informed
consent.^57 Strikingly, none of these legislative or policy commitments expressly references article 37 of
UNDRIP.

Treaties and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: The Significance of Article 37 • Kirsty Gover
85
In  [[New Zealand]] , jurisprudence on the principles of the  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi so far supports an approach
in which  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi rights are not limited by the competing rights of third parties. Article 37 can
be drawn upon to bolster and stabilize this approach. At the risk of over-simplifying complex debates
about the meaning of the  [[Treaty]]  articles and principles, the rights of Māori to tino rangatiratanga^58
are not expressly qualified in the  [[Treaty]] ’s text by the rights of non-Māori. Instead, the guarantees to
Māori set out in article 2 rights stand in relation to the  [[Crown]] ’s  [[sovereignty]]  or kawanatanga^59 asserted
in article 1 and the guarantee of equal citizenship rights to Māori in article 3. While courts have made
it clear that the  [[Crown]] ’s  [[Treaty]]  obligations to Māori are not “absolute and unqualified,”^60 and that
the  [[Crown]]  has “other responsibilities as the  [[government]]  of  [[New Zealand]] ,” jurisprudence to date has
not suggested that Māori  [[Treaty]]  rights can be limited by the rights of other citizens, for example,
by the rights enumerated in the NZBORA (which include the right to be free from discrimination).^61
Instead, judges have suggested that the  [[Treaty]]  expresses a limit on the authority of  [[New Zealand]] ’s
public  [[government]]  by recording the conditional consent of Māori signatories. In the words of the Privy
Council, for example, the  [[Treaty]]  embodies “the obligations which the  [[Crown]]  undertook of protecting
and preserving Māori  [[property]] ...in return for being recognised as the legitimate  [[government]]  of the
whole nation by Māori.”^62
Conclusion
Treaties have an expressly reparative and constitutive character, rather than a basis premised on
distributive justice. Because of the distinctive nature of the entitlements to  [[property]]  and authority
they protect,  [[treaties]]  invite us to look back to the establishment of the state to address the liberal
concept of “consent” that is thought necessary for legitimate governance. The historical and persistent
lack of Indigenous consent to settler governance, coupled with the frequency of state breaches of  [[treaty]]
commitments, undermine the premises of the settler state’s claim to legitimately represent a single
sovereign people. Popular  [[sovereignty]]  does not supply the necessary “will of the people” where the
consent of Indigenous nations is missing. Agreement making offers a way for settler states to negotiate
limited Indigenous consent (consent to some features of the settler state infrastructure, in return
for fewer encroachments on Indigenous  [[sovereignty]] ), but those agreements must be insulated from
distributive principles that would otherwise require primary goods to be allocated among all citizens
in a way that is formally non-discriminatory.
Article 37 can assist in making clear that the rights protected in Indigenous-state  [[treaties]]  are not to
be treated as just another part of the corpus of human rights protections. They are constitutional and
constitutive bargains that establish the limits of the state’s authority to govern.
58 The Māori terms here are those that appear in the Māori language version of the  [[treaty]] . See the authoritative translation of the  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi by
I.H. Kawharu, who explains that in this context rangatiratanga means “the unqualified exercise of chieftainship.” IH Kawharu, ed, Waitangi: Māori and
Pākeha Perspectives of the  [[Treaty]]  of Waitangi (Auckland: Oxford  [[University]]  Press,  [[1989]] ) at 319.
