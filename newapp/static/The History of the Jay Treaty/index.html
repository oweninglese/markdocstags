3.1. Introduction
US and [[Canadian]] border security measures all too often ignore the
concerns of [[North]] [[American]] [[indigenous]] peoples. In borderlands regions,
and especially for affected [[native]] populations, border security without
cross-border stability and cultural continuity can mean no security at all.
A broad observance of the letter and spirit of a little known, yet significant,
[[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United States]] and Great [[Britain]] in [[1794]]
could change this paradigm.
[[American]] [[Indian]]s born in Canada^2 ([[ABC]]s) enjoy access to the
[[United States]] unrestricted by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),
a right stemming from the Jay [[Treaty]] ([[1794]]).^3 An examination of this
right, now codified at § 289 of the INA, reveals qualifying [[ABC]]s are
entitled to privileges unparalleled by all but [[United States]] citizens to enter
and remain in the US ‘for the purpose of employment, study, retirement,
investing, and/or immigration’^4 or any other reason.
This chapter outlines the [[history]] and development of the Jay [[Treaty]],
the rights of [[ABC]]s today and the scope of [[ABC]] status. It analyses the lack
of reciprocity in Canada and explores the issues of cross-border mobility
and commerce. It provides illustrations of these issues through case law,

and as applied in the [[Arctic]] region. It concludes by submitting that active
engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on cross-border mobility issues is
crucial to the ongoing development of sound border security and policy.
3.2. History
Long before [[Europe]]an contact, travel across what is now the US/Canada
border was an element of daily life for the people of numerous [[North]]
[[American]] [[indigenous]] nations. The international boundary was established
by Great [[Britain]] and the US in the Peace of Paris, which divided [[North]]
America without regard for its [[indigenous]] nations.^5 The [[indigenous]]
peoples resented a boundary passing through territory that had been
theirs since time immemorial and viewed the newly established border as
an infringement on their sovereign rights.
In [[1794]], to address issues unresolved by the Peace of Paris or arising
thereafter, Great [[Britain]] and the US negotiated the Jay [[Treaty]]. As part of
this [[treaty]], the parties sought to relieve tribal tensions arising from the
imposition of the new boundary.^6 In relevant part, Article III of the [[Treaty]]
provides:
‘It is agreed that it shall at all Times be free to His Majesty’s Subjects,
and to the Citizens of the [[United States]], and also to the [[Indian]]s
dwelling on either side of the said Boundary Line freely to pass
and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective
Territories and Countries of the Two Parties on the Continent of
America (the Country within the Limits of the Hudson Bay Company
only excepted)...’
The Jay [[Treaty]] did not create a new right for the continent’s [[indigenous]]
people; rather, it recognised their pre-existing right to move freely
across the land.^7 In [[1796]], an explanatory provision was added to the
[[treaty]] providing that no further [[treaties]] should derogate from the rights
guaranteed by Article III.^8 During the War of [[1812]], Jay [[Treaty]] rights were
suspended. The Supreme Court of the [[United States]] has held that the War
of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]] and that, following the war, the [[Treaty]]
of Ghent revived the rights of [[native]] tribes predating that conflict.^9 ,^10
The US continued to recognise the right of [[indigenous]] people to
pass across the border freely until enactment of the Immigration Act
of [[1924]] (Act of [[1924]]), which provided for only those eligible for
citizenship to enter the US.^11 Because [[indigenous]] people were ineligible

for citizenship as a result of race-restricted naturalisation laws dating to
[[1790]],^12 the Act of [[1924]] barred their entry to the US.^13 Shortly thereafter,
the US [[government]] used this as a basis to deport [[ABC]]s who had not
registered as aliens or obtained immigrant visas.^14
In the [[1927]] McCandless case, an [[ABC]] named Paul Diabo was
arrested and ordered deported for entering the US in violation of US
immigration laws. He challenged his deportation, based on the Jay
[[Treaty]].^15 In defence of its position, the [[government]] argued that the War
of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]], relying on the general principle that
war between nations ends all prior [[treaty]] rights, and those rights are
only reborn if a new [[treaty]] provides them.^16 ,^17 On appeal, the Court found
in favour of Diabo.^18 It reasoned that [[treaties]] stipulating permanent
rights, professing to aim at perpetuity, do not end upon occurrence of
war, but are merely suspended until the war ends and revived when
peace returns.^19 Because Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] grants the right to
freely cross the border in perpetuity, the right is permanent in character;
thus, the War of [[1812]] did not abrogate the Jay [[Treaty]].^20 Further, in [[1815]],
the US and Great [[Britain]] signed the [[Treaty]] of Ghent, which again
recognised the [[Indian]]s’ prerogative to move freely across the border,
removing any doubt as to the existence of that right.^21
3.3. Scope: A Determination based on Racial
Considerations
[[Congress]] codified the [[Indian]]s’ right of free passage across the border
with the Act of 2 [[April]] [[1928]] (Act of [[1928]]):
‘[T]he Immigration Act of [[1924]] shall not be construed to apply to
the right of [[American]] [[Indian]]s born in Canada to pass the borders
of the [[United States]]: Provided, That this right shall not extend to
persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created
by adoption.’^22
This provision remained in effect until [[1952]], when [[Congress]] enacted the
INA. INA § 289 modified the language of the Act of [[1928]] by replacing
the adoption provision with a bloodline requirement – the only racial
metric in US immigration law:
‘Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect the right of
[[American]] [[Indian]]s born in Canada to pass the borders of the United

States, but such right shall extend only to persons who possess at
least 50 per centum of blood of the [[American]] [[Indian]] race.’^23
With no legislative [[history]] on point, the basis for bloodline requirement
is unclear, but it is reasonable to assume it stemmed from then recent
case law and statutory definitions of ‘[[Indian]]’ outside of the immigration
context. In the [[1947]] opinion US ex rel. Goodwin v. Karnuth , a federal
district court analysed the term ‘[[Indian]]’.^24 After noting the term was not
defined in [[United States]] Code (USC) sections dealing with immigration,
the Court looked to other sections of the Code defining the term. It
noted the definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ used in 25 USC Chapter 14, which governs
an array of issues pertaining to [[Indian]] peoples and land: ‘The term
“[[Indian]]” as used in [this Act] shall include all persons of [[Indian]] descent
who are members of any recognized [[Indian]] tribe now under Federal
jurisdiction... and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more
[[Indian]] blood .’^25
The Court then cited the canon of statutory interpretation that
‘[[Congress]] may well be supposed to have used language in accordance
with the common understanding’,^26 and that ‘[t]he popular or received
import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of
public laws’.^27
Applying this canon, the court determined that ‘the words
“[[American]] [[Indian]]s born in Canada”, found in [the Act of [[1928]]] must be
given a racial [rather than political] connotation.’^28 It then addressed
the second clause, which read: ‘Provided, That this right shall not extend
to persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created
by adoption.’^29 The court reasoned that inclusion of the second clause
‘means that such adoption does not make the adoptee an [[American]]
[[Indian]] by “blood”, entitling him to free entry under the first clause. One
whom nature has not made an [[American]] [[Indian]] cannot be made one by
adoption in some [[Indian]] tribe or family.’^30
This opinion and the statutory definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ interpreted in
Goodwin were published after the Act of [[1928]] (which did not contain
a blood quantum requirement) and prior to the [[1952]] enactment of the
INA (which did). Although there is no definitive legislative [[history]] on
the matter, the drafters of INA § 289 likely knew of this reasoning
when they removed the adoption language from the Act of [[1928]] and
expressly replaced it with the blood quantum requirement. Beyond this,
[[Congress]]ional reasoning for retaining the racial basis for [[ABC]] classification
remains unclear.^31

3.4. Canada
3.4.1. [[indigenous]] groups in Canada: [[indian]], inuit,
Métis and métis
Section 35(1) of the [[Canadian]] Constitution names three separate
[[indigenous]] cultural groups under the umbrella term ‘[[Aboriginal]]’ for the
purposes of Canada’s constitution:^32 [[Indian]],^33 Inuit and Métis.^34 In this
context, the term ‘[[Indian]]’ is therefore used in a distinct way from Inuit
and Métis. The question then remains whether the Inuit and Métis
peoples are eligible for [[ABC]] status.
While the Inuit do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s, and Canada expressly
distinguishes Inuit from [[Indian]]s, as far as the US is concerned, [[Canadian]]-
born Inuit are eligible for rights under INA § 289 upon establishment
of the requisite blood quantum.^35 ,^36 The US does not rely on [[Canadian]]
definitions in deter[[mining]] which groups qualify for the benefits of INA
§ 289,^37 and US courts have held that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ includes Inuit.^38
An examination of the statutory language introduced both prior to and in
the INA indicates a clear intent to broaden the applicability of Jay [[Treaty]]
rights beyond only those individuals who are members of [[Indian]] tribes.^39
Because Inuit are [[Indian]]s as far as the US [[government]] is concerned, Inuit
peoples born in Canada who possess the bloodline requirement may
qualify for [[ABC]] status.
Like the Inuit, Métis do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s and are distin-
guished as a separate [[indigenous]] group from [[Indian]]s in Section 35 of
Canada’s Constitution.^40 The term ‘métis’ originates from a [[French]]
word meaning ‘mixed’ and was historically used in [[Canadian]] [[French]]
for persons of mixed ancestry.^41 While ‘métis’ generically denotes mixed
[[indigenous]] ancestry,^42 when capitalised, the term refers to a specific
population of [[indigenous]] and [[French]]-[[Canadian]] origin which emerged
from the marriages which took place in the early 19th century between
[[French]]-[[Canadian]] fur [[trade]]rs and local [[indigenous]] people.^43 The Métis
maintain a strong and unique identity, with specific criteria dictating
membership within the community.^44
Meanwhile, the question of whether Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s^45
are ‘[[Indian]]s’ under Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]], has long
been the subject of legal debate. Section 91(24) is the provision of
Canada’s Constitution through which the federal [[government]] of Canada
derives jurisdiction over the subject matter of ‘[[Indian]]s, and Lands reserved
for the [[Indian]]s’.^46 In [[2013]], a Federal Court ruled in Daniels v. Canada
This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC
40 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC
that both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s are included as [[Indian]]s ‘within the
meaning of the expression “[[Indian]]s and Lands reserved for the [[Indian]]s”
contained in s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]].’^47 On 17 [[April]] [[2014]],
the Federal Court of Appeal upheld that decision in part: it ruled that
only Métis, and not non-status [[Indian]]s, are included as [[Indian]]s within
the meaning of the [[Canadian]] Constitution.^48 But on 14 [[April]] [[2016]], the
Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) unanimously restored the ruling of
the Federal trial court, which held both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s
are ‘[[Indian]]s’ for the purpose of section 91(24) of the Constitution
Act, [[1867]].^49 In its decision, the Court clarified that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ or
‘[[Indian]]s’ in Canada’s constitutional context has two meanings: ‘a broad
meaning, as used in s. 91(24), that includes both Métis and Inuit and
can be equated with the term “[[aboriginal]] peoples of Canada” used in s. 35,
and a narrower meaning that distinguishes [[Indian]] bands from other
[[Aboriginal]] peoples.’^50
The definition of [[ABC]] is contingent only on birth as a [[Canadian]]
citizen and satisfaction of the requisite blood quantum. Métis identi-
fication alone is insufficient to qualify for [[ABC]] status; an individual must
satisfy the bloodline requirement, a matter independent from Métis
identity. The same rule applies to métis. For this reason, while the recent
ruling of the SCC has significant implications for the rights of Métis and
non-status [[Indian]]s in Canada, it has no bearing on their qualifications for
[[ABC]] status. Ultimately, for INA § 289, whether individuals are [[Indian]],
Inuit, Métis or métis, they will qualify for [[ABC]] status if they were born in
Canada and can satisfy the bloodline requirement.
3.4.2. No Reciprocal Right to Enter Canada
The SCC decisions regarding the validity of Jay [[Treaty]] rights have been
informed by the fact that the [[Canadian]] Parliament has never enacted
enabling legislation required for the Jay [[Treaty]] to have force of law in
Canada.^51 ,^52 Thus, the [[Canadian]] [[government]] holds that the Jay [[Treaty]]
does not affect the admissibility of US-born [[indigenous]] persons to
Canada.^53 Admissibility of all non-citizens to Canada is governed by the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,^54 which does not incorporate
Jay [[Treaty]] rights. The [[Canadian]] Immigration Act states that ‘every person
registered as an [[Indian]] under the [[Indian]] Act has the right to enter
and remain in Canada in accordance with this act, and an officer shall
allow the person to enter Canada if satisfied following an examination
on their entry that the person is a... registered [[Indian]]’. However, the
registration requirements of the [[Indian]] Act have proven difficult, and

Jay tREaty aND CRoss-boRDER MobiLity aND sECuRity 41
[[Canadian]] courts have declined to broaden its applicability; thus, US-born
[[indigenous]] persons are not extended a reciprocal right of entry to Canada
under the Jay [[Treaty]].
In [[1956]], the SCC in Francis v. The [[Queen]]^55 unanimously held that
a [[treaty]] such as the Jay [[Treaty]] is not enforceable in Canada without
enabling legislation.^56 While Canada does not recognise a reciprocal
right of entry for US-born [[indigenous]] persons, [[Canadian]] courts
have recognised and protected an [[aboriginal]] right to freely pass the
border.^57 This right is protected by Canada’s Constitution in Part II of
the Constitution Act, [[1982]] (Constitution Act).^58 Section 35(1) of the
Constitution Act recognises and affirms ‘the existing [[aboriginal]] and
[[treaty]] rights of the [[aboriginal]] peoples of Canada’.^59 Section 35(2) defines
‘[[aboriginal]] peoples of Canada’ to include the [[Indian]], Inuit and Métis
peoples of Canada.^60 While [[Canadian]] courts have declined to recognise
Jay [[Treaty]] rights as existing [[treaty]] rights under Section 35, it is within
Section 35 that [[Canadian]] courts find authority to recognise existing
[[aboriginal]] rights.
In [[1990]], the SCC decided R. v. Sparrow , analysing the rights
of [[aboriginal]] peoples in light of Section 35.^61 The Court held that
Section 35(1) should be given a generous and liberal interpretation in
favour of [[aboriginal]] peoples, that the [[government]] cannot extinguish
an [[aboriginal]] right without a clear intention to do so, and that the
[[government]] may regulate or infringe on such rights only if the inter-
ference meets the test for justification laid out by the Court.^62 It established
four factors to analysing a claim under Section 35(1): (1) ‘whether an
applicant has demonstrated that he or she was acting pursuant to an
[[aboriginal]] right’; (2) ‘whether that right was extinguished prior to the
enactment of s. 35(1)’; (3) ‘whether that right has been infringed’; and
(4) ‘whether that infringement was justified’.^63 This test continues to be
employed by the SCC when analysing 35(1) claims.
In the [[1996]] case of R. v. Van der Peet, the SCC analysed the
substantive rights recognised and affirmed by Section 35(1).^64 The Court
described Section 35(1) as ‘the constitutional framework through
which the fact that [[aboriginal]]s lived on the land in distinctive societies,
with their own practices, customs and traditions, is acknowledged and
reconciled with the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Crown]].’^65 The Van der Peet Court
articulated a test for identifying [[aboriginal]] rights – the ‘integral to a
distinctive culture test’. It directs that ‘in order to be an [[aboriginal]]
right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition
integral to the distinctive culture of the [[aboriginal]] group claiming the
right’.^66 To qualify, the ‘practice, custom or tradition must be of central

42 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC
significance to the [[aboriginal]] society in question – one of the things which
made the culture of the society distinctive’.^67 The Court concluded that
[[aboriginal]] rights must be based on those that existed prior to contact
with [[Europe]]an society.^68
Watt v. Liebelt^69 raised the question of whether ‘it could be contrary
to an existing [[Aboriginal]] right of an [[Aboriginal]] people of Canada, as
guaranteed in the Constitution, for an [[Aboriginal]] person who is [an
[[American]] citizen], and neither a [[Canadian]] citizen nor registered under
the [[Indian]] Act of Canada, to be ordered to depart from Canada for a
crime committed [in Canada]’.^70 While the Court of Appeal did not
ultimately reach a decision on the issue, it quashed the order of deportation
and remanded the case for further fact-finding on the tests previously
established in Sparrow and Van der Peet.
Recently, the case of R. v. Desautel^71 again raised the issue of whether
a US-born [[indigenous]] person not resident in Canada may assert an
[[aboriginal]] right to enter Canada, and the court found they could. The
appellant was Richard ‘Rick’ Desautel, a member of the US-based Lakes
Tribe of the Colville Confederated Tribes (‘Lakes Tribe’) and a resident
and citizen of the [[United States]]. The Lakes Tribe is a successor group of
the Sinixt people, whose traditional territory extends both north and
south of what is now the US-Canada border. In [[2016]], Desautel asserted
an [[aboriginal]] right to hunt for ceremonial purposes by shooting and
[[kill]]ing an elk in traditional Sinixt territory in Canada. He was charged
with hunting without a licence, and hunting big game while not being a
resident of [[British]] Columbia, contrary to the Province’s Wildlife Act.^72
In his defence before the [[British]] Columbia Provincial Court,
Desautel asserted his actions were protected by Section 35. In opposition
to Desautel’s claim, the Province argued 1) an [[aboriginal]] group must
reside in Canada to be considered an [[aboriginal]] people protected by
Section 35 in Canada, and 2) Desautel’s claimed hunting right is incom-
patible with [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]].^73 The court acquitted Desautel of the
charges. It found he was exercising an [[aboriginal]] right of the Sinixt/Lake
People to which Section 35 protections applied, and that the relevant
sections of the Wildlife Act unjustifiably infringe this right.^74 The Province
appealed to the [[British]] Columbia Supreme Court,^75 which again found
for Desautel.^76 The Province’s subsequent request to appeal the matter to
the [[British]] Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA) was granted, and after
considering the arguments of the parties, the court again sided with
Desautel.^77 At the deadline for finalising this chapter and forwarding it to
its publisher, it is unknown whether the Province will seek leave to appeal
the BCCA decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Another recent case has drawn much-needed public attention to
the issue of cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]] persons seeking
access to their traditional lands in what is now Canada. Dr Mique’l
Dangeli is a US-born member of Tsimshian Nation. Her people’s
traditional territory spans the border between [[Alaska]] (US) and northern
[[British]] Columbia (Canada). As one of the few remaining [[flu]]ent speakers
of Sm’algya̱x, the Tsimshian language, she moved to Canada to teach
Sm’algya̱x in her community’s traditional territory, but after ongoing
complications with [[Canadian]] immigration, she was forced to leave
Canada after her post-graduate work visa expired.^78 While she was later
able to secure the right to work in Canada through an employment visa
based on her status as a professor, she continues her fight for her right to
live and work in her traditional territory as an [[indigenous]] person. She
has started a petition calling on the [[Canadian]] [[government]] to reciprocate
the Jay [[Treaty]], which eloquently states the issue:
‘The colonial border between the US and Canada dissects
Indigenous territories in ways that sever the lifelines between First
Nation families, communities, languages and ceremonies. Every
year thousands of US-born [[First Nations]] people who are Indigenous
to Canada are denied the ability to live and work in Canada because
the [[government]] refuses to recognize their ancestral rights to do so.
Yet through the Jay [[Treaty]], the relatives of these same people who
are born in Canada and have [[Indian]] Status can live and work in the
US. How is it possible that the US, with its extreme policies against
immigration, honours the rights of Indigenous peoples regardless
of citizenship and Canada does not?’^79
The rights of [[ABC]]s are firmly settled in the US under INA § 289, rooted
in the Jay [[Treaty]]. As the foregoing discussion suggests, there is no
reciprocal Jay [[Treaty]] right for US-born [[indigenous]] persons to enter
Canada, and the rights of US-born [[indigenous]] persons under [[Canadian]]
law are still evolving. The conclusion of this chapter includes a discussion
of continuing developments in this regard.
3.5. An Exploration of the Jay [[Treaty]] in the
[[North]]ern Borderlands
The Jay [[Treaty]] provisions drafted to relieve tribal tensions originally
arose from the establishment of an international boundary along what is

44 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC
now the mainland US-Canada border. As security measures have moved
to the forefront of modern concern, the Jay [[Treaty]] has become diminished.
In the 21st century, [[native]] populations face a variety of cross-border
mobility challenges:
‘[S]ecurity has meant increased difficulty in pursuing intertribal
[[trade]] and exchange, greater obstacles to delivery of social and
health services to tribal members who live across national borders
and the attenuation of social and kinship networks... [B]arriers to
border mobility undercut efforts to keep alive or re-create cultural
traditions and practices that [[native]] leaders claim are critically
important to the identities and well-being of their members.’^80
These concerns transcend the 49th Parallel – they extend across the
[[North]]ern Borderlands: along the [[Alaska]] (US)/Canada border and across
the [[Arctic]] region.^81
3.5.1. the [[arctic]]
The [[Arctic]] region is home to over 500,000 [[indigenous]] peoples^82 spanning
40 ethnic groups.^83 The [[Arctic]] settlement area is divided between eight
countries: Canada, the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], Norway,
Iceland and [[Denmark]].^84 In [[1996]], the [[Arctic]] Council was created ‘with
the purpose of advancing circumpolar cooperation. The mandate of the
Council is to protect the [[Arctic]] environment and promote the economies
and the social and cultural well-being of northern peoples’.^85 The Council
consists of the eight above-mentioned [[Arctic]] States, along with six
Indigenous Peoples Organisations representing [[indigenous]] interests,
the intent being ‘to engage [[Arctic]] [[indigenous]] peoples in the cooperation
in recognition of their right to be consulted in any issues concerning the
stewardship of their ancestral homelands’.^86
Although those ancestral homelands are now divided by interna-
tional boundaries, ‘the [[indigenous]] peoples of the [[Arctic]] view themselves
as having a historical existence and identity that is separate and
independent of the states now enveloping them’^87 – a claim to [[sovereignty]]
at the heart of the Jay [[Treaty]]’s intent. While each distinctive cultural
group in the [[Arctic]] has its own unique issues and experiences, one major
common challenge faced across these communities is cross-border
mobility and the Jay [[Treaty]].
It is noted that a Desautel fact pattern could easily arise in the
[[Arctic]], where subsistence hunting remains a reality of daily life for many

communities. In the most remote areas, the border is still unmarked
and a hunting trip across an unmonitored boundary line may only
become known to the hunter upon review of their GPS coordinates at
the end of the day. A US-born [[indigenous]] person engaged in hunting
of migratory species such as caribou, whose migration routes crisscross
the border, could easily trigger charges like those currently faced by
Desautel should their hunting cross into Canada. Regardless of who
prevails should the Desautel case reach the Supreme Court of Canada, as
development in the [[Arctic]] continues to impact natural resources
and animal populations, it is only a matter of time before both the US
and Canada begin to monitor hunting and fishing in this region with
heightened scrutiny.
For brevity, this chapter will focus on exploring the issue of
cross-border mobility in the [[Arctic]] as applied to the Inuit, the most
northerly of the [[Arctic]] peoples.
3.5.2. a Case study: the inuit
‘We Eskimo are an international community sharing common
language, culture, and a common land along the [[Arctic]] coast of
Siberia, [[Alaska]], Canada and Greenland. Although not a nation-
state, as a people, we do constitute a nation.’^88
As introduced in Section 3.4.1., the Inuit are not [[Indian]]s; however,
they may qualify for [[ABC]] status upon establishment of the requisite
bloodline. There are nearly 60,000 individuals who identify as Inuit
in Canada,^89 and approximately 15,700 Inuit living in [[Alaska]].^90 A
discussion regarding the right of free passage for Inuit is not confined
by the borders of the US and Canada. Inuit traditional lands span across
the circumpolar region in the US, Canada, [[Denmark]], Greenland and
[[Russia]].^91 In [[1977]], the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) was founded to
‘speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine
their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way
of life’.^92
In its first conference that same year, Inuit from Canada, Greenland
and the US ([[Alaska]]) discussed this common vision,^93 proposing the
right of free travel across traditional Inuit lands of the circumpolar
region. The conference presented Resolution 77–13, which ‘call[ed]
upon Canada, the [[United States]] and [[Denmark]] to provide for free and
unrestricted movement for all Inuit across their [[Arctic]] homeland’.^94
Resolution 77–13 was rooted in the rights bestowed by the Jay [[Treaty]],

and also referenced the concept of [[aboriginal]] rights, then yet to be
recognised by the Supreme Court of Canada:
WHEREAS, a [[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United States]] and
England provides intercourse and commerce across the U.S./[[Canadian]]
border ; and
WHEREAS, we Inuit are the [[indigenous]] people of the [[Arctic]] and
have freely visited and [[trade]]d back and forth across our homeland
for thousands of years, thus establishing our [[aboriginal]] rights to free
and unrestricted travel and trading all across the [[Arctic]]; and
WHEREAS, the Jay [[Treaty]] between the [[United States]] and England
clearly recognizes and protects our rights to unrestricted intercourse
and [[trade]] across the U.S./[[Canadian]] border ; and
WHEREAS, these guarantees have never been negotiated with
[[Denmark]], and have not been properly established in Canada,
resulting in the fact that our circumpolar Inuit community does not
enjoy the right of free travel and [[trade]] across the [[Canadian]]/
Greenlandic border; and
WHEREAS, our [[aboriginal]] rights to travel and [[trade]] freely along the
[[Arctic]] coast will be an important factor in the economic growth of
our circumpolar community;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the delegates assembled
at the first Inuit Circumpolar Conference call upon the Governments
of Canada, the [[United States]] and [[Denmark]] to negotiate an
agreement that will protect for all Inuit the right to unrestricted
[[trade]] and travel as envisaged between Canada and the [[United States]]
by the Jay [[Treaty]].^95
While the Jay [[Treaty]] originally envisaged unrestricted [[trade]] and travel
across the border, the provision relating to [[trade]] was never codified in
§ 289 – an array of customs and environmental laws govern the transport
of goods across the border. The regulations and restrictions imposed by
these laws often provide exceptions for the traditions of [[indigenous]]
communities; however, these exceptions rarely contemplate cross-border
cultures, and may only be asserted by communities on one side of
the border. Without Jay [[Treaty]] protection in this regard, cross-border

[[indigenous]] cultures would be well-served with a strong proponent in
international policy and legislative development. The ICC is not only a
Permanent Participant of the [[Arctic]] Council, but it also holds Special
Consultative Status with the United Nations, and has been involved
with the [[World]] Summit on Sustainable Development, the Convention
on the Trade of Endangered Species, the [[World]] Intellectual Property
Organization, the Organization of [[American]] States, the International
Whaling Commission, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).^96 These
global connections make the organisation a strong player in developing
the [[Arctic]]. As the [[Arctic]] continues to develop, the ICC is an ideal advocate
for cross-border policies that recognise and respect the traditional
practices of cross-border cultures.
3.6. Cross-Border Culture and Commerce
Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] states in part ‘[n]o duty of entry shall ever be
levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation
into the said territories respectively, nor shall the [[Indian]]s passing or
repassing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature,
pay for the same any import or duty whatever’.^97 However, the US
[[government]] does not recognise the continued validity of this provision in
the way it has Jay [[Treaty]] rights regarding free passage.^98
In US v. Garrow , a [[1937]] US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals
case, the court opined that the Jay [[Treaty]], including its duties provision,
was abrogated by the War of [[1812]].^99 The court maintained the [[Treaty]] of
Ghent was not self-executing and was not enacted by legislation;
therefore, no [[treaty]] right remained for the duties provision.^100 Although
statutory exemptions from customs duties had been maintained in
various iterations of the Tariff Act, the exemption was deleted in [[1897]].^101
No legal basis remained for the [[Treaty]]’s duties provision.
Nearly 30 years later, the federal district court in Akins v. Saxbe noted
that language granting [[Indian]]s the right to pass with their goods duty free
‘was not included in the Tariff Act of [[1897]],^102 and it has not been included
in any subsequent tariff act’.^103 It maintained questions of customs duties
and importation to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the customs
courts.^104 Meanwhile, in [[2001]], the SCC held that there exists no [[aboriginal]]
right to transport goods duty free across the US-Canada border.^105
Despite restrictive policies in force today, traditional [[indigenous]]
cross-border commerce and culture is well-documented: ‘[a]boriginal

economies were vibrant – they produced and [[trade]]d, often over long
distances and through elaborate [[trade]] coalitions. Trading relations
evolved over millennia... It is a mistake to assume that [[Aboriginal]]
peoples and their economies were local, static, subsistence-oriented or
unresponsive to opportuni ties for wealth generation.’^106
Even if the communities cannot access one another to the extent
they once did, their long-standing traditions of cross-border commerce
and culture continue to survive despite the US-Canada border; a boundary
line aptly described as a ‘figment of someone else’s imagination’.^107
Indeed, ‘[f]rom the [[Indian]] viewpoint, he crosses no boundary line. For
him this does not exist.’^108
The Blackfeet (US) and Kainai (also known as the Blood or
Kainaiwa) (Canada) provide an illustration of the many tribes whose
lands were bifurcated by the drawing of this boundary line, and whose
traditional practices are affected by its imposition.^109 ‘Today there is con-
siderable intermarriage and contact [between the Blackfeet and Kainai]
through social, recreational and religious events... These gatherings
form the center of tribal cultural and religious life. Tribal members often
[[trade]] animals, meat, berries, roots, herbs, handmade goods and medicine
bundles at these events.’^110 However, both ‘[[Canadian]] and [[American]]
customs laws... forbid the import and export of certain plants and animals
that are significant in ceremonial life. In addition, these laws require a
search of all goods, thereby inhibiting the exercise of tribal culture and
religion.’^111 While a customs search may seem a benign inconvenience to
a non-[[indigenous]] person, it can be devastating to the integrity of certain
sacred items.^112
The current debate over eagle feathers, which carry religious
significance for many [[indigenous]] cultures, provides an illustration of
the competing interests and policies at play. Under the Bald and Golden
Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), possession of eagles or eagle parts carries
civil and criminal penalties.^113 However, a religious exception to BGEPA
allows enrolled members of federally-recognised [[Indian]] tribes to apply
for a permit allowing them to possess or take bald or [[gold]]en eagles or
their parts.^114 Policies exist to allow members of federally-recognised
tribes to travel with eagle parts between the US and Canada or [[Mexico]]
without a permit in certain circumstances,^115 and [[Canadian]]s presenting
a Certificate of [[Indian]] Status may travel in and out of the US with
eagle parts under similar circumstances.^116 All items are still subject to
customs declarations.^117 Because the policy for [[Canadian]]s is restricted

Outside of ceremonial implications, well-intentioned and important
legislation aimed at protecting endangered or threatened wildlife has
also created unanticipated economic difficulties for [[indigenous]] [[Canadian]]
populations, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) being one
example.^118 The MMPA bans the import of marine mammals and marine
mammal products into the US.^119 The practical effect is ‘[a]n [[American]]
[[Indian]] or Eskimo living one mile west of the [[Alaska]]n-[[Yukon]] border can
sell traditional handicrafts made from seal skin into the “lower 48”, while
a [[Canadian]] [[Aboriginal]] person living one mile east of the same border,
cannot do so’.^120
Another challenge to cross-border mobility for [[ABC]]s is the [[[[West]]ern]]
Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) – a result of the Intelligence Reform
and Terrorism Prevention Act of [[2004]] (IRTPA)^121 – which requires
US and [[Canadian]] travellers to present a passport or other approved
document denoting identity and citizenship when entering the US.^122
While WHTI-compliant tribal documents do exist, they are not common,
and in their absence, the issue of passports serves as a barrier – particu-
larly because [[ABC]] status is not dependent on tribal membership.^123
Significant numbers of [[indigenous]] people do not carry US or [[Canadian]]
passports, either as a matter of [[sovereignty]] (they consider themselves to
be members of their own [[indigenous]] nation, and may choose to carry a
tribal passport rather than a US or [[Canadian]] passport) or for practical
purposes (it may not be reasonable for a tribal elder living in a remote
region to travel to a passport application centre).
If WHTI requirements are not modified for [[ABC]]s, their Jay [[Treaty]]
right of free passage will remain limited. A non-expiring WHTI-compliant
Jay [[Treaty]] Card would remedy this situation. The Jay [[Treaty]] Card could
be issued by the Department of Homeland Security upon the applicant
evidencing their identity and qualification for the status. The process of
documenting as an [[ABC]] is outside the scope of this chapter, but in short,
it involves presenting the Department of Homeland Security a host of
documentation including long form birth certificates for the applicant,
their [[parents]] and possibly their grand[[parents]], as well as tribal records
that indicate blood quantum.
Border security and species protection are the realities of the world
we live in, and they will continue to impact [[indigenous]] cross-border
commerce and culture. However, it is possible to mitigate adverse effects
through recognition of Jay [[Treaty]] principles, encouragement of cross-
border relationships and, most importantly, consulting with [[indigenous]]
peoples in the development of laws and policies that affect their
traditional ways of life.

50 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC
3.7. Conclusion
The Jay [[Treaty]]’s provision guarding [[indigenous]] cross-border mobility
remains in effect in the US. Meanwhile, Canada has failed at implement-
ing a workable solution to cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]]
peoples. Canada has not developed a workable Jay [[Treaty]] alter[[native]],
with the only possible option being the very narrow ‘integral to a distinctive
culture test’ set out by the Van der Peet Court – which the [[government]]
of [[British]] Columbia has been con[[testing]] relative to its applicability to
US-born [[indigenous]] peoples residing in the US, in Desautel.
Canada’s position puts it squarely at odds with Article 36 of the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which reads:
1. Indigenous peoples, in particular those divided by international
borders, have the right to maintain and develop contacts, relations
and cooperation, including activities for spiritual, cultural, political,
economic and social purposes, with their own members as well as
other peoples across borders.
2. States, in consultation and cooperation with [[indigenous]] peoples,
shall take effective measures to facilitate the exercise and ensure
the implementation of this right.^124
A recent development in Canada may suggest positive progress toward
softening resistance to border crossing rights for [[indigenous]] peoples. In
[[2016]], the [[Canadian]] Senate’s Committee on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples heard
from [[Canadian]] [[government]]al and [[indigenous]] organisations regarding
impediments to the maintenance of cultural and family ties between
cross-border [[indigenous]] communities. The Committee recommended
that the Minister of Indigenous and [[North]]ern Affairs Canada appoint a
special [[representative]] to explore solutions to border crossing challenges
faced by [[indigenous]] communities across Canada.^125 The Minister
appointed Fred Caron to this position.^126 He was directed to engage with
[[indigenous]] communities on border crossing issues and file a fact-finding
report on the outcome of his engagement.
Caron filed his report, titled Report on First Nation border crossing
issues , on 31 [[August]] [[2017]].^127 The report documents myriad cross-border
issues experienced by [[indigenous]] communities across Canada and
addresses potential solutions. Out of all the potential solutions raised in
the report, [[Canadian]] ratification of the Jay [[Treaty]] constitutes the broadest
and most thorough:
‘[W]hile there was a belief on the part of some of the First Nation
[[representative]]s I met with that the current issues would not exist

had Canada implemented the Jay [[Treaty]], there was also a view that,
in order to set the path forward, what is required is a mechanism to
recognize inherent and Jay [[Treaty]] rights in a modern context. All
who expressed themselves on the subject were of the view that
recognition of these rights should be an integral part of the federal
[[government]]’s commitment to reconciliation and the recognition of
a nation-to-nation relationship. Such recognition, in their view,
would honour and respect their identity as [[North]] [[American]] [[Indian]]s
having long-standing historical relationships with Canada and the
US based on historical [[alliance]]s and [[treaties]].’
Whether the report results in [[government]] action remains to be seen.
Ultimately, until Jay [[Treaty]] rights receive significant rehabilitation in the
US and recognition in Canada, the [[Treaty]]’s intent will be met in only a
lukewarm fashion, if at all. Further incursions will rapidly diminish its
usefulness to the [[indigenous]] peoples it was designed to serve. Ultimately,
it is clear that active engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on this
issue, by both the US and [[Canadian]] [[government]]s, is crucial.

2 ‘[[American]] [[Indian]]s born in Canada’ ([[ABC]])
is a term of art arising from US statute.
This chapter will occasionally use the
term ‘[[Indian]]’ to refer generally to
[[indigenous]] peoples of [[North]] America,
with the acknowledgment that
certain [[indigenous]] groups who do not
self-identify as [[Indian]] may still qualify for
[[ABC]] status. See Section 3.4.1. This is done
as needed for consistency with the statute
or with historical narrative. However, this
chapter will use the term ‘[[indigenous]]’
where possible to refer generally to the
[[native]] peoples of [[North]] America. It is
further noted that in Canada, the term
‘[[Aboriginal]]’ is a specific legal term used
in the [[Canadian]] constitution and other
legal contexts to refer to [[indigenous]]
peoples. This chapter will only use the
term ‘[[Aboriginal]]’ within direct quotes
or when making reference to the
specific legal meaning under Canada’s
Constitution. Other common terms such
as ‘[[American]] [[Indian]]’, ‘[[Native]] [[American]]’,
‘[[Native]]’, ‘[[Alaska]]n [[Native]]’, ‘[[First Nations]]’ or
other alter[[native]]s will also only be used
within the context of direct quotes or
where otherwise indicated.

short and simple definition: ‘[[Indian]]s:

31 Spruhan, ‘[[Canadian]] [[Indian]] Free Passage

retention of the bloodline requirement
may be the then national policy of [[Indian]]
termination, which began in the [[1940]]s
and was embraced by the Eisenhower
administration from [[1953]]–60. See Ralph
W. Johnson, ‘Fragile Gains: Two Centuries
of [[Canadian]] and [[United States]] Policy
Toward [[Indian]]s’, [[Washington]] Law Review
66 ([[1991]]): 643, 662. ‘The [[United States]]
identified assimilation and integration as
the official rationale for the termination
policy, but there is evidence that the
desire to reduce federal expenditures for
[[Indian]] nations was a major motivation for
the termination acts’. Robert T. Coulter,
Termination, [[Native]] Land Law § 8:2
([[2012]] ed.). The bloodline requirement
serves to disqualify many from status as
[[ABC]]s.

self-identify themselves as Métis and are
accepted by a Métis community as Métis.’
The Métis National Council [http://www.

Non-status [[Indian]]s, on the other hand,

51 See e.g., Francis v. The [[Queen]], [[[1956]]]
S.C.R. 618 (Can.).
52 In order for a [[treaty]] to have force in
Canada, implementing legislation is
required. Canada’s status as a dualist state
and the effect that status has on the Jay
[[Treaty]] was made clear in Francis v. The
[[Queen]]. The terms ‘monism’ and ‘dualism’
have been used to describe different types
of domestic legal systems. Oxford
[[University]], The Oxford Guide to Treaties ,
368 (Duncan B. Hollis ed., Oxford
[[University]] Press, [[2012]]). In dualist States,
which include Canada and almost all
other [[British]] Commonwealth States, ‘no
[[treaties]] have the status of law in the
domestic legal system;... all [[treaties]]
require implementing legislation to have
domestic legal force’. By contrast ‘[In]
[m]onist States... some [[treaties]] have the
status of law in the domestic legal system,
even in the absence of implementing
legislation.’ Oxford Guide to Treaties , 369.
The Supremacy Clause of the US
Constitution establishes the Constitution,
federal statutes, and US Treaties as ‘the
supreme law of the land’. [[United States]]
Constitution article VI, clause 2.
53 See Mitchell v. Minister of National
Revenue, [[2001]] SCC 33, [[[2001]]] 1 S.C.R.
911 (Can.).
54 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,
[[2001]] S.C. ch. 27, (Division 3, Entering
and Remaining , § 19(1) (Can.)).
55 Francis v. The [[Queen]]. While the case
involved customs issues rather than the
right of US-born [[Indian]]s to cross in to
Canada, both issues fall under the Jay
[[Treaty]]; therefore, its language is important
and relevant to the admissibility of
US-born [[Indian]]s into Canada.
56 In an interesting side-note, the US/
Canada border itself was created by [[treaty]]
but never codified by legislation in
Canada. See Phil Bellfy, ‘The Anishnaabeg
of Bawating: Indigenous People Look at
the Canada-US Border’, in Beyond the
Border: Tensions Across the Forty-Ninth
Parallel in the Great Plains and Prairies 7,

66 R. v. Van der Peet, 527. The Court
employed this test as the starting point for
the tests laid out by the Court in Sparrow.
67 R. v. Van der Peet, 509 (‘A court cannot
look at those aspects of the [[aboriginal]]
society that are true of every human
society (e.g., eating to survive) or at those
aspects of the [[aboriginal]] society that are
only incidental or occasional to that
society’).
68 R. v. Van der Peet, 550–62. The Court
outlined ten factors to consider when
applying the integral to a distinctive
culture test:
Courts must take into account the
perspective of [[aboriginal]] peoples
themselves... Courts must identify
precisely the nature of the claim being
made in deter[[mining]] whether an
[[aboriginal]] claimant has demonstrated the
existence of an [[aboriginal]] right... In order
to be integral a practice, custom or
tradition must be of central significance to
the [[aboriginal]] society in question [it was
one of the things that truly made the
society what it was]... The practices,
customs and traditions which constitute
[[aboriginal]] rights are those which have
continuity with the practices, customs and
traditions that existed prior to contact
[prior to the arrival of [[Europe]]ans in [[North]]
America]... Courts must approach the
rules of evidence in light of the
evidentiary difficulties inherent in
adjudicating [[aboriginal]] claims... Claims to
[[aboriginal]] rights must be adjudicated on a
specific rather than general basis [must be
specific to the particular [[aboriginal]]
community claiming the right]... For a
practice, custom or tradition to constitute
an [[aboriginal]] right it must be of

independent significance to the [[aboriginal]]
culture in which it exists... The integral to
a distinctive culture test requires that a
practice, custom or tradition be
distinctive; it does not require that that
practice, custom or tradition be distinct...
The in[[flu]]ence of [[Europe]]an culture will
only be relevant to the inquiry if it is
demonstrated that the practice, custom or
tradition is only integral because of that
in[[flu]]ence... Courts must take into account
both the relationship of [[aboriginal]]
peoples to the land and the distinctive
societies and cultures of [[aboriginal]]
peoples.

that while Canada’s Immigration and

individuals who are registered [[Indian]]s
under the [[Indian]] Act, this right only serves
a small subset of US-born [[indigenous]]
persons. As developed at Sections 3.3. and
3.4. of this chapter, the Jay [[Treaty]] is not
contingent on registration or membership
in any federally-recognised tribe or band.

81 The term ‘49th Parallel’ is a common

regulations state that the permit allows

transportation is restricted to [[Indian]]s
‘authorized to participate in bona fide

exception might initially appear a good
compromise, many have claimed that the
permitting requirement and process
burdens their free exercise rights. ‘The
majority of claimants rely on the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) for
relief. These cases often reach the federal
courts of appeals, but the [[United States]]

whether the religious exception to BGEPA
